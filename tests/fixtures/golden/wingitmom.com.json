I'm realizing that consciously going with the flow helps me to get things done and keep my cool when situations don't go as planned!\n\nToday I got all three kids packed up for a trip to Six Flags. We were all super psyched to go and I had finally convinced my husband, Russ, to go with us. We were running late, but I decided since our only goal was to be together as a family, I wasn't going to worry about it. We stopped for coffee and an egg wrap (even though I didn't need anything and we were running late).\n\nAs we were pulling out of the drive through line I heard that yucky, yet familiar noise followed by \"Mom! She puked!\"... For real?\n\nChange of plans again.\n\nWe headed home to clean her up and knew it wasn't the right day for rides. The kids",

You may even be asking \"Am I a wing it mom?\" Chances are the answer is yes.\n\nI'll try to provide you some answers while I sit in the glow of my laptop screen sitting on the toy cluttered floor of my 18 month old's room as she is finally dozing off... which is a form of paying my dues for stinking at sleep training.\n\nLife as moms means winging it... going with the flow... and feeling like you never <em>quite</em> have it all together!\n\nNo fancy quizzes, no points to tally....\u00a0You are a wing it mom if you've ever found yourself in a situation similar to any of these:\n\n*Juggling three kids, you carry in three bags of groceries - and don't notice the bag of ice pops and lunch meat is still in your trunk hidden behind the stroller.\n\n*You let your kids play in the fountain at an amusement park in their regular clothes. They'll dry *shrug*\n\n*You sometimes sit in your recliner chair like a queen and admire the amount of devastation your children can invoke upon your kingdom in 10 short minutes.\n\n*Your neighbor shows up unannounced and says something like \"So this is what a house looks like when you have three kids.\"\n\n*You open a package of crackers in the middle of the grocery store to keep your kids quiet.\n\n*You sometimes just put all the art supplies on the table and banish your children to the dining room \"until they've made something awesome\" because you just need a break.\n\n*You get all the way to the store and realize you haven't brushed your teeth... or hair.\n\n*On a trip to the dinosaur park\u00a0 you realize you forgot the sippy cup... so you are the weird person asking for an empty cup and lid.\n\n*You are reading <em>You are a Badass</em> to your 18 month old as her bedtime story as she falls asleep because it's the only reading time you get.\n\nI may find myself adding to this list from time to time... but you get the gist!\u00a0 If any of these scenarios sound like you, or things you've experiences I'm proud to anoint you a wing it mom!\n\nI hope you'll enjoy coming along this wing it mom journey with me!

These may seem sort of simple, but the goal is really to provide about 15 minutes to enrich her day in addition to our regular play, visits to the park, library story hour etc. The goal is just to talk about things, read stories, sing songs, and of course - make a mess! Talk about the colors, count when you can, and just get down and play with your little one! Most importantly, don't stop yourself from trying things that might be a little tough for your toddler! If you end up being the only one singing, or find yourself being the one sorting out the shapes, it's totally fine! You are showing your kiddo a great model of what these type of skills and activities look like!\n\nBig brothers went back to school this week, so it was a perfect time to kick our activities off with a school bus theme!\n\nHere are 5 quick and easy bus themed activities for your toddler at back to school time!\n\n<em>Note: This post contains affiliate links. This means that by clicking on and purchasing these products, I make a small commission at no additional cost to you.\u00a0As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.</em>\n<h2>Finger painting:</h2>\nYou can finger paint pretty much anything. Just observe your toddler with mashed potatoes at dinner. This activity encourages sensory exploration, color recognition and practice, and vocabulary development!\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-65 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Finger-Paint.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2. Happy Kids On the Bus- Draw kids on the bus, or place happy stickers on the bus photo. My little one is sticker crazy right now, so this one actually took quite a while... and many many stickers! This is a great tie in to emotions as well as a way to convince her that buses are not just evil yellow tornadoes coming to whisk her brothers away from her.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-63 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Untitled-design-18.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Coloring-</h2>\nDon't forget that good old fashioned coloring is a great way for your kiddo to express their creativity! This one I just give her the (washable) markers and let it go! This is also a great time to mention vocabulary related to parts of the bus (tire/ wheel, window, front, back)\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_64\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"560\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-64\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Untitled-design-19.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /> As you can see... this one has already found its way to our fridge.[/caption]\n<h2>Wheels on the Bus-</h2>\nMake balls/ tire shapes with black playdough- there is no room for professional detail here. Then match them to the wheels on the buses in the picture. Count as you go!\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Finger-Paint-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></p>\n&nbsp;\n<h2>\u00a0Basic Sorting:</h2>\nThis kind of activity is awesome for really young kiddos! It helps them to develop categorizing and organizational skills. My 18 month old sorts about 4 at a time, and that's all her attention span can handle for now, but she loves it! And it is definitely helping to increase her vocabulary!\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-75 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Finger-Paint-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDon't forget <strong>pretend play!</strong> Use a play bus or cars to pretend play. We like to count to three and then roll the car back and forth, count the people figures we put inside, and even drive it down roads made with blocks or playdough (for our small toy car sized)\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-67\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Finger-Paint-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></p>\nThis is the bus toy that we have! <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ND3KGU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000ND3KGU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teachermom06-20&amp;linkId=0b00fc63b9b2c0e8bc4b21245f9e91ab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pink Lil' Movers School Bus Little People by Fisher-Price (Styles Vary)</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=teachermom06-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000ND3KGU\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" />\n\nWe also sing The Wheels on the Bus all week long.

    "content": "<img src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-are-you-reading.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-102\" />\nHey! I just met you, and this is crazy... but what are you reading to your baby?\n\nI start off by placing this disclaimer right here..  I am a teacher by training and at heart. I have a Master's Degree in Remedial Reading and Language Arts... my undergrad studies are in English. It probably comes as no surprise to you that I was the kind of mom who packed a book in my hospital bag before having each of my babies and I read to them from the day they were born.\n\nWhen my babies were born, the days got busy and they looked like little squishy bundles who seemed to sleep, eat and cry. They certainly didn't seem to be paying attention to the books I was reading anyway. Why was it important to make reading part of our routine? The thing is that as moms we know that time escapes us... the little habits that fall out of our daily schedules often go by the wayside, and are even more difficult to reintroduce when the time is right. The fact is, if you stop reading to your baby, how will you know that it's the right day to start? I was so afraid I'd somehow forget to start reading, that I just started on day 1, and made sure we read every day from that point on. I also had this feeling that maybe they were listening.\n\nThe truth of the matter is... your squishy little baby is listening, to every single thing you say (a lesson I learned the first time a four letter word came out of Rjs mouth). From the time they are born they are listening. They are watching and soaking in every word you say. Reading to your baby is a great calming and bonding experience, but also opens up huge opportunities for your baby to hear language and vocabulary and to just hear your voice!\n\nWhether it's luck or not, I've also grown 3\u00a0 kids who LOVE to read... and when asked how I got them to be that way, I just can't help but attribute it to our every day reading! From the time they're super small, you're modeling that reading is a good, warm experience and can even be a social one. Before long you'll see him/her sitting on the floor flipping through, or chewing on their own little books as they explore reading themselves... or piling up all their books and flopping right into your lap \"Mommy a boop\"(as Ellie says when she wants to read). When you model being a reader for your child, and practice reading with them... I just believe they have a much greater chance of becoming independent and excited readers.\n\nSo this leads us to the big question- what are you reading to your baby?\n\nI actually come from the camp that it doesn't really matter what you read, just that you read. Sure we have tons of board books around the house and we read them on repeat all.day.long... but the truth is her bedtime story is actually the only time of day I have to sneak in my reading in. I sit down next to her bed, hold her hand, and read to her. Currently we're reading \"You are a Badass.\" Maybe some of the positive vibes from the book will float into her little head and she'll grow up knowing she can have all that she desires in this world.\u00a0At very least, I'm reading and she's listening. \n\n<img src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Untitled-design-20.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-100\" />\n\nHere's the takeaway, in case you're a busy mom looking to get the whole gist of the article in the last couple lines- Read to your baby (and kids)... model reading yourself because they are listening... even if you're reading \"You are a Badass.\"\n\n<em>Side note (And affiliate disclaimer: This is affiliate link.

I have so so many things to be grateful for. Not just thankful, but truly deeply grateful. I've been doing tons of reading... right now I'm reading both <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0762447699/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0762447699&linkCode=as2&tag=teachermom06-20&linkId=ffa6de0a381471efe73228ed58306a29\">You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life</a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=teachermom06-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0762447699\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /> and listening to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072TMB75T/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B072TMB75T&linkCode=as2&tag=teachermom06-20&linkId=3b1b6383c46f6971606bb68deb952e50\">Girl, Wash Your Face: Stop Believing the Lies About Who You Are so You Can Become Who You Were Meant to Be</a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=teachermom06-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B072TMB75T\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />... and one theme I hear repeated again and again is to live gratefully... even when your fridge is left open overnight right after you grocery shop and have to throw out all the dairy products- live gratefully... even when you go to the store to replace all the groceries and your car breaks down in the parking lot, thereby warming up all the repurchased dairy products- live gratefully (both of these things truly happened to me within the past 24 hours.\n<img src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Untitled-design-21.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-112\" />\n\nGuess what? I have the means to repurchase the groceries, I have a husband to come jump start my car, the guy diagonally across from me in the packed parking lot pulled out just in time for my husband to pull in to jump start my car, I have three beautiful kids, I am a stay at home mom, I'm sitting here writing to you, and there are sunflowers in my yard. There are so so many things to be grateful for! \n\nOften we think of the things we want to have, or wish we had, or even things we think we'll never have. It's really easy to feel stressed rather than grateful in those moments... but here's what I am beginning to realize- I have a family because I work to create positive relationships, I am a stay at home mom because as a family we have set our selves up for this reality, I blog because I make the time, and I have sunflowers because we planted them.\n\nSo this post is definitely a little bit of mushy gooshiness, but here's the <strong>busy mom takeaway: Live gratefully, and if you want sunflowers in your yard... plant them!</strong>",

Often times, I wasn't even sure what we were going to have. I read and watched as other awesome mamas were meal planning as a part of their nutrition regimen. I decided that it was time for me to give meal planning a try!\nHere are 4 of the perks of meal planning I've discovered along the way:\n<h2>1. My family stopped bugging me!</h2>\nWhen I started meal planning I had an answer to this question the first time it was asked. There was no longer a need for my family to put the question on repeat! The ways that I have meal planned have all also included posting the menu on the side of the fridge so I they can check themselves!\n<h2>2.\u00a0 I planned healthier meals</h2>\nWhen I was sitting down on Sunday morning to plan the meals for the week, I am ambitious and excited about eating healthy meals all week long. I am much less likely to default to \"let's get a pizza\" or \"It's getting late... We'll stop at Mickey D's\".\n<h2>3. I save money</h2>\nWhen I sat down to plan meals,\u00a0 I often did what I call \"piggy bag planning\". If I plan for tacos during the week, I'll use some sour cream for tacos, and the rest for a baked potato later in the week. If I add a sandwich that I want lettuce for, I also plan for salads so we use the entire head of lettuce.\u00a0 Because of this we have much less waste in our home and spend less on groceries each week!\n<h2>4. It saves time!</h2>\nKnowing the kinds of meals we're going to be having gives me the opportunity activate some time saving powers. One example is, if I am chopping veggies for a salad, I'll take out and do some meal prep for the veggie flatbread pizzas we'll be having the next night.\u00a0 The next night, when I'm ready for dinner, I wont need to get the cutting board out again, rinse, chop, clean up and then get the pizzas ready. Another example really engages in that \"piggy back planning\" that I mentioned before. If I make breaded eggplant sandwiches, I'll just cook the whole eggplant in slices the first night, even though we only need 4 or 5. Since the pan is already hot, the breading mess is already out, and I'm waiting for it to cook- I'll get a pan out, put some sauce in the bottom, and start preparing an eggplant parm dish for the next day. It takes a little bit more time the first night, but saves tons the next.\n\nIt has definitely been a nice game changer for my family, and I've tried to plan a few different ways (<a href=\"https://wingitmom.com/3-ways-for-busy-moms-to-meal-plan/\">read about 3 ways to meal plan here</a>).\n\n<em>Let me know in the comments your fun reasons for meal planning!</em>",

Here are three of my favorite ways to meal plan!\n<h1>1.Trello</h1>\n<a href=\"https://trello.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trello</a> is an organizational website and app. I use trello to create a board for the month, then create cards for each week and put the menu items we'd like to have under each week. Using this app I can also copy and paste any links to recipes I'd like to try out. I like that I can access it from wherever we are, and edit it as needed.\n<h1>2.List to Online Order:</h1>\nAnother strategy, and also my most recent favorite, is to jot down a basic list to post on the fridge. Then I immediately open up my app for the grocery store pick up or delivery of choice (I've used Stop and Shop and Walmart in our area) and add the groceries meal by meal into my shopping cart. This is kind of like double duty. At that point I can either order the groceries for delivery or pick up the next day, or use my online \"cart\" as a list when I go to the store.\n<h1>3.Sticky Note Planning-</h1>\nI think it might be the teacher in me... but I love sticky notes. I always used them for planning when I was in the classroom full time... and I use them as a mom. I made a cute little sticky note template that I can use the small sticky notes on it. The thing I like about this template is that if you change your mind about what you'd like day by day, you can just shift the sticky notes around. I also cut off the bottom of my template and write my lists as soon as I'm done adding my sticky notes. Here's the template I use- Feel free to use it yourself as well (Just make sure you don't select fit to page when printing or else the sticky notes won't fit.).\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-121\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sticky-note-menu-template.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"379\" height=\"491\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDo you have any other fun ways to meal plan?",

I've been losing weight I never thought I could and talking to people I never felt worthy of talking to. I shared pictures of myself in my messy closet with just a tank and some leggings to track my weight loss progress... on Facebook. People I've worked with and whose children I've taught, and family members, and even sort of strangers saw these pictures. I went away with a bunch of ladies OVERNIGHT away from my kids and had a good time! I'm writing to you here on this blog... sharing the little and big things that are a part of my life after over 2 years of owning this site and just letting it sit.\n\n<strong><em>You're probably wondering...Why Now? And where on earth did I finally get the bravery?</em></strong>\n\nSomething really sad happened to me. My grandfather died. He took his own life. Just a couple weeks before our annual family trip to go see him. I was angry, I was sad. I was at a standstill emotionally. How could he do this to my grandma? How was everyone supposed to pick up these pieces? I couldn't understand how everything he said he was so excited for was never going to happen. He prided himself in his great grandchildren knowing him, and he loved how they were telling all their friends how they had great grandparents. He wanted to watch them grow each year splashing away in his back yard pool... and now not only did we lose that chance... but now this is the memory he left his great grandchildren, grandchildren, children, wife, friends... all of us.\u00a0 I was angry.\n\nThen I was sad. Sooo sooo sad. My grandpa had a sharp mind and years and years of story after story to tell over a nice glass of red wine late at night after we tucked the kids in on our visits. A part of that brilliant mind, I have now learned, was also too stubborn and strong to differentiate between the sad stories he was telling himself and the reality of all he had in this world. He felt that maybe people didn't love him and maybe didn't care about him for all sorts of random reasons. Or maybe he was getting old (he was only 72) and what if his best days were behind him.\u00a0 And guess what?\u00a0 None of this was freaking true! We all just loved him so much. We all knew there was no one else in this world just like him. He could have had many more amazing adventures on this earth. He wasn't listening to any of that, hearing it, or feeling it.\n\nI spent many (the days blurred together) quiet afternoons in my chair just thinking and trying to reason.\u00a0 As I sat there it occurred to me that was sort of doing the same exact thing in my life...I was telling myself sad stories too and I wasn't even living a sad life. I was happy in my life and blessed with 3 beautiful children and a husband and a wonderful extended family. I was (and am still) bubbling over with gratefulness, but I also I felt guilt around every corner... I felt bad for working, I felt bad for leaving teaching. I felt bad for putting my kids to bed too late, and bad for not spending more time with them when I put them to bed early. I felt ashamed of my appearances and my weight, but bummed when I was a drag at a picnic because I was the one eating healthy. I was petrified of people stopping by my house because, if I'm being honest, it's always a disaster... but I often felt lonely and wished people would visit. I thought most people I talked to probably thought I was stupid and annoying, but also found myself sad if I sat alone and quiet.\u00a0 And none of these sad stories are, or need to be freaking true either!\n\nAnd then something started happening within me in those very quiet and silent moments. I decided today is the day for all the things I'd been putting off. I decided I am strong enough to live this life the way it was meant to be lived. I am vowing to be a bright light in this world and to do everything I can to soak up every moment and smile and event in my life. To have the conversations, to give a disclaimer at the door (\"Come in.. careful of the legos\") instead of meeting people out on the front step. I've also decided to stop thinking of what people think of me because (as I've learned in some of the amazing books I've been reading) it's none of my business anyway.\u00a0 Most importantly, it is time to stop having these strange sad narratives in my mind.\n\nSince I am an incurable \"bright sider\" I try to look for the bright side of every situation. In trying to make sense of all this I couldn't find any good in this situation, just sadness. There is no \"good that grows\" from a tragedy like this.\u00a0 Since things will never be the same anyway,\u00a0 why not use the power within myself to light up my own life (and hopefully the lives of some others)? I've decided to dream big and follow those dreams and do the things that make me happy, at peace, and be more of myself than ever before!\u00a0It's not that I learned that life is short... it's that I learned that life is fragile and our minds and dreams are our own to shape... and from all of those feelings and decisions bravery grew.\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-132 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/35495652_10216035217134904_5190248878049329152_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"511\" height=\"383\" />",

One of the ways I have been really learning and growing is through the books I've been reading.\n\nI have a confession: I've been reading \"Self Help\"\u00a0 type books... and it feels so good! (*insert reader eye rolls*)\n\nI know, I know... I avoided these types of books like the plague for a VERY long time! I am not sure exactly why. I guess I wondered if they were a sham. Or tacky. Or corny. Or I was worried about what other people would think of me if I was spotted with any titles like this from across the room...\u00a0 Well I am here to say that I am reading these books, loving them, and I won't apologize for it! These books, although some of the concepts were so new to me that they took warming up to, have opened my mind and reassured me that I do have the power I feel down in my gut to get things done and always move towards my best self living my best life!\n\nHere are 5 of my most recent favorite reads for moms who want to get things done and take back our lives!

No matter how many hours I spend cleaning, it's always a big fat mess! One thing I've struggled with having my kiddos help out in a way that actually helps... rather than just slows the whole process down! As my 10 year old grows, he is definitely more helpful in this department, but it doesn't mean he's always excited to do it!\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Before we really get started...I just need to let you know that this post contains\u00a0affiliate links since I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. This means if you click and buy, I may make a small commission at no additional cost to you!</em></p>\nBefore employing this strategy I would often ask my kids to clean up the playroom which seemed like an insurmountable task to them, so I'd find myself delegating different tasks the whole time, getting frustrated by their distraction, and ultimately yelling, grounding them, and cleaning it myself.\n\nEnter Sticky Notes--- Have I mentioned how much I (and all kids I know) love them? I use them for meal planning, scheduling my work week, lesson planning, and especially for clean up time for my kids!\n\nWe call it \"Sticky Note Clean Up\" And they actually <em>ask</em> me to set them up with it now... unprompted!\n\nThe prep for it involves taking a quick glance at the room, writing a category of mess on each sticky note, and then sticking it to the wall.\n\nSometimes I use a different sticky note color for each child, and other times I just stick them all up there. Either way, this helps to keep them guided as they clean, feel like they are accomplishing completing the task, and keeps them out of my hair.\n\nHere's a sample of my clean up wall!\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-149 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180925_170521016.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"575\" height=\"432\" />\nNow here's a little extra tip! 10 item (or 5 item, or 20 item depending on the scale of the mess) clean up is one of my favorites. It involves picking any 10 items from the floor and putting them where they belong. It's a great way to cover all the random stuff under there!\n\nSo break out those sticky notes, list out the chores, and put those kiddos to work! Use different colors, shapes and sizes to keep them interested time after time!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HD63BM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B003HD63BM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teachermom06-20&amp;linkId=3eb1e0878577f023312222e06229a4b7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=B003HD63BM&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=teachermom06-20\" border=\"0\" /></a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=teachermom06-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003HD63BM\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N16YF1A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01N16YF1A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teachermom06-20&amp;linkId=9a7972d1d9c457d12af376e207159015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=B01N16YF1A&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=teachermom06-20\" border=\"0\" /></a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=teachermom06-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B01N16YF1A\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F9HRZRW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07F9HRZRW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teachermom06-20&amp;linkId=7955e5fac25b97a37ae705fbdbf431da\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=B07F9HRZRW&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=teachermom06-20\" border=\"0\" /></a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=teachermom06-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B07F9HRZRW\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" />\nShare your \"Sticky Note Clean Up\" walls on my <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wingitmom/\">facebook page</a>...

Whether you're reading this on the date it's released, or any random date in the future... you're finding this post just in the right time for you!\n\nI have lately been really thinking hard on what is in my heart that I am trying to put into words and this quote totally sums it up for me:\n<blockquote>\n<h1>\"She designed a life she loved.\"</h1>\n</blockquote>\nI am head over heals in love with this quote because...\n\n1.It reminds me that I am in charge of <em>designing</em> my life, not just experiencing it as a backseat passenger (or worse... a backseat driver)... and that means YOU are in charge of designing your life too! This reason is all about taking my <strong>power</strong> back!\n\n2. It helps me to get into <strong>action</strong>. After all, when I picture my best life, I have some crazy action to get into!\n\n3. The quote is in past tense... forcing me to visualize and picture the time when I'm there... living my best life! It helps to shape my <b>reality</b>! (If you haven't taken a minute to close your eyes and dream big dreams yet.... do it now!)\n\nThis new perspective is definitely inspired by the <a href=\"https://wingitmom.com/5-books-every-mom-boss-should-read/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">awesome books I've been reading</a>, but also most recently, the Last 90 Day Challenge organized by Rachel Hollis!\u00a0 It's all about embracing and really continuing momentum of positive change through the end of the year, instead of slipping backward. You can join her challenge on her page <a href=\"https://thechicsite.com/90days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> (It's totally free and she's amazing).\n\nIn order to help me design my life, I'm following her 5 To Thrive which involve really setting and sticking to 5 daily goals (The specifics will come in your welcome e-mail if you sign up), and I need a little bit of guidance when sitting down and making this progress. I decided to create my own journal to help guide me!

It was such a whirlwind that I haven't had a moment to stop and write about it.\u00a0 The interesting thing I also have to admit is... I forgot the password to login to my blog, and finally figured out how to get back in (Hey, I promised to be real with you).\n\nI always think it's so fun to share and hear about holiday traditions different families have developed each year. It was always one of my favorite assignments to give my class because I loved seeing the pictures and seeing their eyes light up with excitement.\n\nWhen I was little,\u00a0 I most remember going to my aunts house every Christmas Eve. It was my favorite tradition. My great grandma would usually send all the kids Chrsitmas jammies and we'd play with our cousins, binge on soda and sweets, and open a present. I remember the car ride home at night, looking out the window at the sky just hoping and hoping I'd catch a glimpse of Santas sleigh. Ok, can you tell this memory makes me feel totally nostalgic?)\n\nAs I've grown up and am the mom to our party of 5, here are some traditions I've come to love:\n<h2>1.Black Friday Shopping-</h2>\nEach holiday season my mom and I head out to brave the cold Thanskgiving night, coffee in hand and pie in our bellies. We browse around mostly these days, since we do most of our shopping online, but there is still something special about that black Friday shopping feeling for me.\n<h2>2. Christmas lights-</h2>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-173 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Copy-of-5-Favorite-Christmas-Traditions.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nThis tradition started when I was little, and has grown as I have a family of my own. Every year we pick a night to all get in our jammies, make cocoa in our Mickey Mouse travel mugs from trips to Disney past, and drive around to check out the Christmas lights in our town. We have a few really awesome and beautiful homes who synchronize their lights to music.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>3. Gingerbread Houses-</h2>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-174 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Copy-of-5-Favorite-Christmas-Traditions-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nFor the past several years (more than 10 I think), we have had my sisters over to make gingerbread houses with my kids. I am both untalented and a cheapskate, so we only decorate the small gingerbread village ones each year. Years ago my younger sisters were kids, so it was perfect. Of course as time has gone by one is an adult and one is a junior in high school and they still come to decorate gingerbread houses. This year, we had dinner and cake for my brother's birthday, which is in December, and then everyone (even all the grown ups) decorated.\n<h2>4. Decorating the tree-</h2>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-175 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Copy-of-5-Favorite-Christmas-Traditions-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nThis tradition is evolving. We have an artificial tree, and typically we have set it up the weekend after Thanksgiving, however the past couple years have been an exception. This past Thanksgiving we were traveling for my grandfathers service, and the year before we were on vacation, but regardless, It's always fun to have the kids put up their handmade ornaments from years past. We actually got a new bigger tree for our living room this year and made that one a little more basic/traditional, and we set up our smaller tree with handmade ornaments in the dining room next to our fake fireplace (listen I go for low maintenance all the way around).\n\n(PS... Can you tell exactly how tall Ellie is? At almost 2, she was more into undecorating the tree than decorating it)\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>5. Extended Family Get together-</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is like the new version of my favorite childhood memory... The weekend before Christmas I had my extended family over. It fills my heart to fill my home with aunts, uncles, cousins, cousins kids.\u00a0 More than 40 people spilled in on Saturday night, followed by my grandmas homemade mac and cheese, my dads cheesy potatoes, one aunt's famous meatballs, another aunt's delicious pasta salad, and yet another aunt's gourmet cheese platter. We had corn casserole (this was delish... I have never tasted anything like it), salad and cookies... lots and lots of cookies. Years ago we used to do what we called a \"Yankee Swap\". All the grown ups brought a gift valued at a certain amount and we'd play a fun game to end up with a random surprise gift. It was super fun, but it was also difficult to find great gifts over the years, and the tradition sort of petered out over time. Instead, now we do a cookie swap. Everyone brings a couple types of cookies they like to make, and we shop it like a wonderful cookie buffet and fill our trays with a variety of Christmas cookies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThese are just a few ways we get into the Christmas spirit, in addition to the gingerbread lattes, random Christmas carol dance parties, and a whole slew of Christmas movies that also sprinkle the Christmas season for us.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite holiday traditions?\n\n&nbsp;",

I felt like I was in one of those bad holiday movies where you think \"All those things cannot possibly happen to one family\"\n\nLet's rewind to Saturday December 22. We had our big family get together and it was a great time, although in hindsight I suspect there were some germs floating around there due to the events that would unfold over the next 72 hours.\n\nMy middle kiddo does have pretty yucky asthma though, and of course he had woken up Saturday morning with one of his \"rough coughs\" which typically indicate an impending asthma attack which lands us in the hospital. I called the pulmonologist and we started him on some steroids to try to avoid another (yes another) hospital visit near Christmas time this year. Luckily, he perked up quite a bit (too much even with the steroid he was quite full of it).\n\nSunday felt like\u00a0 day where we were trying to just make the time pass. We were all prepared for Christmas (or so we thought) and we just were excitedly waiting for Christmas Eve when we get together with my parents and siblings. We played games all day and watched A Christmas Story. It really was a nice low key day. I tucked my kiddos in excited myself that the very next night Santa would be coming...\n\nand then... it happened.\n\nAt 4:00 am Carter was up crying that his stomach hurt and he was so hungry. I gave him a granola bar and sent him to bed, thinking that this was probably the side effect of 2 days worth of steroids... but then it really happened...\n\nOur little Ellie woke up and instantly threw up all over our bed (don't judge... sometimes she sleeps in the middle). Then she acted fine... We hoped it was a fluke... until I heard Carter cry \"MOM!\" and I knew... he had thrown up too.\n\nAfter cleaning up I got right into the car and drove to the store. We had no gatorade, no tylenol, no basic saltine crackers... I was not prepared to wing it.\u00a0 Halfway through my very quick store trip my stomach began to gurgle.\n\nAs you can imagine, without anymore detail it was a miserable Christmas Eve. the 3 of us were so very sick the whole day.\n\nLuckily, by morning we were feeling a lot better (but not 100%). Thankfully we were able to catch some smiles for opening presents and it was a good morning!\n\nLet's talk about what unfolded next...\n\nAt around 4pm, our oldest, RJ began to complain of his stomach. I knew what was coming (we had been bracing ourselves). Within an hour of the start of his sickness, Carter began to have a pretty bad asthma attack. We just couldn't get it under control, so I ended up taking him to the Emergency Room, which is where we spend Christmas evening (He ended up being diagnosed with pneumonia the next day by the pediatrician, which is a pretty terrible diagnosis for an asthmatic kiddo.)... So let's just summarize this... within an hour I had one child begin a terrible sickness and he couldn't even move off the couch and I had another one who needed to be rushed to the emergency room. My heart was torn in half. How in the world do you leave either one?\n\nThere was so much disappointment, the \"canceling\" of our typical Christmas Eve, and then the rescheduling of RJ's birthday sleepover which was scheduled for just 2 days later (we are NOT the kind of people who try to spread germs on purpose)\n\nThankfully, in true wing it mom fashion- I promised the kids we would reschedule Christmas Eve, and we did just that! Friday evening we carried on the entire day like it was Christmas Eve. We decorated our sugar cookies, we played Christmas music, and we went to my parents' house for dinner and to exchange gifts. It did feel like Christmas thankfully! Ironically, through all of our precaution and waiting, we STILL somehow mentioned to get my entire family sick more than 3 days after we had been sick. This was just a tough bug I guess.\n\nIt was definitely a year where we dug deep and held onto our gratitude for all we have to celebrate that things could be worse. At least we were able to be together. Christmas 2018 has been officially dubbed a Very Merry Sickmas.\n\n&nbsp;",

In fact I've had a whole list of Christmas posts to share with you, which have been stuck on my todo list for quite some time!\n\nOne of my favorite things to do is to bake cookies! One of the reasons is probably that we avoid sweets the rest of the year, but we give into the holiday time of year and eat all the yummy things!\n\nHere are 5 of my favorite cookie recipes for Christmas time.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-181\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Copy-of-5-Favorite-Christmas-Traditions-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nI LOVE these sugar cookies! They hold their shape, they are perfectly balanced in flavor and they are soft. I actually make these throughout the year whenever there is an event, I just pick a differently shaped cookie cutter and voila!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.inkatrinaskitchen.com/best-sugar-cookie-recipe-ever/\">Here's a link to the recipe I use.</a>\n\nIf you are wondering how I found this recipe... it was by googling \"Best Sugar Cookie Recipe\"... and I think the results were pretty accurate this time Google!\n\nChocolate Mint Cookies\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-182\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-5-Favorite-Christmas-Traditions.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nI am a true mint cookie lover. This recipe I avoided for a while because it involved melting chocolate and chilling the dough, however, now that I've made them, they are definitely a favorite and one my kiddos (and other family members) scold me for skipping if I try.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16212/chocolate-mint-candies-cookies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here's a link to the recipe I use!</a>\n\nChocolate Dipped Oreos\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-184\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-5-Favorite-Christmas-Traditions-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nThis cookie doesn't even need a recipe! This year I just bought a pack of regular and a pack of mint oreos (I told ya, I love mint), and a couple cups of microwavable baker chocolate. I melted the chocolate, dipped the oreos and sprinkled them with whatever sprinkles I wanted! The only thing I have tried that doesn't work well is the sugar crystal sprinkles. Otherwise it's super easy, no baking required and they look pretty fancy!\n\nPeanut Butter Blossoms\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-185\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-5-Favorite-Christmas-Traditions-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nHere's another \"Great for anytime\" type of recipe. Peanut butter blossom cookies are a definite favorite. My brother and sister in law make a delicious peanut butter chocolate chip cookie, and one of the two I think will be required at any future get together. It is just the perfect combo.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.hersheys.com/kitchens/en_us/recipes/peanut-butter-blossoms.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here's the recipe I use!</a>\n\nPillsbury Sugar Cookies\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-186\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-5-Favorite-Christmas-Traditions-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nThis may seem like a cheat... but...I am a sucker for good old fashioned pillsbury store bought sugar cookie dough. It's the kind I grew up on and is the only way to make cookies for Santa. Roll out the dough and cover them obnoxiously with all the sprinkles.\u00a0 The only recipe instruction I have is that... I love them barely cooked and chewy. yummm. The kids are always in charge of making these cookies and it's become a very delicious tradition.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere are some honorable mentions which we also love:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/240521/andes-mint-cookies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Andes Mint Surprise Cookies</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/recipe/herseys-kisses-chocolate-chip-cookies-17259960\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0Hershey Kisses Chocolate Chip Cookies</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spendwithpennies.com/grandmas-shortbread-cookies-cookie-press/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Easy Shortbread Cookies</a>\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-199 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Penguin-Fun.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nWe've been so excited to keep going with our fun thematic kind of \"play at home\" activities. This week we're full into winter fun with reading and playing all about penguins!\n\nI always like to incorporate a bunch of different activities even if they are really \"too hard\" for my daughter. I see a huge value in her exposure to the activities even if she's watching me model the activities or doing some sort of variation of the activities.\n\nThis week we read a few informational books about penguins. Sometimes I read all the text, and sometimes I pull out the vocabulary and we point to the pictures. I don't ever really wash down the vocabulary, even if it does seem \"above her head\". It's really one of the best ways to increase background knowledge and vocabulary acquisition, which is essential to early literacy development.\n\nHere are the informational books we read this week.\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-192 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"373\" height=\"373\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe learned that penguins like to eat fish! So we pulled out our first activity\n<h2>1.Penguin Paths</h2>\nThis is basically a multi-use map, which is why I decided to laminate it (with my brand new laminator which is AMAZING by the way).\n\nThere are so many ways to use these mats, we decided to trace them with our fingers, I held her hand and she traced, and then we lined the gems up along the lines together (be careful to supervise, because these are choking hazards). You could also make playdough snakes, trace with a dry erase marker, place pom poms or a number of other materials onto these mats. I made mine double sided with two different \"levels\" of lines.\n\nWhen we did the activity together, she started by pushing the gems one at a time, but then ultimately filled up the entire mat and said she was \"all done\". Totally fine (and expected) for a 23 month old! As you go through your play at home learning, just wing it!\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-193\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"293\" height=\"293\" /><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-194\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"324\" height=\"323\" />\n<h2>2.Peekaboo Penguin</h2>\nOne of the books talked about how penguins come from eggs, so we made our own peekaboo penguin. She colored the penguin and I cut out the egg. Then we attached it to a popsicle stick and could make the penguin pop out of the egg. This is a really fun way to begin the learning about life cycles with really young kids!\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-195 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"553\" height=\"553\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>4. Penguins on Ice!</h2>\nFor this activity we practiced counting! I placed the numbers 1-5 on sticky notes and put it on each plate. We looked over the penguin counters (they are all different kinds of penguins) and talked about all the penguins. She loved the ones with little eyebrows.\nThen we counted them out onto the different paper plates (icebergs).\u00a0 Again, it's totally fine if your little one doesn't know how to count yet! Ellie is great at recited counting and can point and count up to 3, but she is still working on this skill. Even just having her place the penguins on the paper plate is a great activity.\n\nIn this particular activity she asked for glue right away. So we ended up gluing the penguins on the plate (for the numbers 1,2, and 3 but then she was done gluing). I attached the numbers to the back of the plates so shes having fun this week just flipping them over and pointing at the penguins.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-196 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>5.Dress Me Up Penguin</h2>\nWe also decided to do a penguin dress up. This was perfect as a follow up for reading Tacky the Penguin.\n\nWe colored in the pieces and then she got to choose how to dress up her penguins.\u00a0 \u00a0You could also laminate these pieces and attach some velcro pieces to the big penguin and to the backs of the clothing pieces. You could also do the same with magnets and attach the penguin to a cookie sheet with magnets on the back of each of the pieces.\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-209 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Copy-of-Social-Media-\u2013-Untitled-Design-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"449\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>6.Penguin or Polar Bear?</h2>\nOn two separate paper plates, I placed the sorting pieces for polar bear and penguins.\n\nThen we sorted the polar bears onto one plate and penguins onto another.\u00a0 We'll definitely do this again next week when we play all about polar bears.\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-206 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Copy-of-Social-Media-\u2013-Untitled-Design-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" />\n<h2>7. Paper Plate Penguin</h2>\nPaint the back of a paper plate black (As you can see our old black paint is suffering and dried a shade of grayish purple... oh well!). Then fold the sides in, top down, and have your little one add eyes/ googly eyes and a beak. You can also add feet, but she was all done, so we left it at these. I applied the paperclips just so the glue could dry to hold the top of the paper plate face down.\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-208 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-11.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"402\" height=\"402\" />\n<h2>8. Penguin Stories:</h2>\nWe have a few fun penguin stories here at home, but also have borrowed from the library, or even utilized online read aloud videos to listen to some stories!\n\nHere are some links to our favorites:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EmMmBW8YgNY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBJUmesOS0k\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6dMidnGLRGI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you'd like to use these resources with you kiddo(s) you can get the PDF version here:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BA1jQ13_qBL4lERXHzeqPPWR4kteFvGP/preview\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-213\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/penguin-toddler-fun.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"212\" height=\"274\" /></a></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BA1jQ13_qBL4lERXHzeqPPWR4kteFvGP/preview\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe>\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "<img class=\"size-full wp-image-204 aligncenter\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Roadtrip.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nSince my grandparents moved to Myrtle Beach, we've been making annual (or sometimes twice a year) trips to visit them.\u00a0 We've driven to Florida a few times too. My kids are at the point where an hour and a half drive is \"super short\".\u00a0 When we first started our trips we were a family of four, and now we're a family of 5 with an almost 2 year old.\n\nDuring our most recent drive to travel to my grandfathers funeral service, I began to think about all the ways we had sort of planned and deliberately made some choices which would help us wing it when we needed to, and help us avoid winging it when we didn't.\n\nSo here they are... my list\u00a0 of:\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">10 Tips for Long Trips with Kids</h1>\n<h2>1. Drowsy Driving (for the kids of course)</h2>\nIf you're trip of exceptionally long and you will be traveling for most of the daylight hours, leave when your kids are still drowsy. Sometimes an interrupted sleep schedule will work to your advantage in the form of extra naps along the way. For us we leave between 3am - 4:30am. I have friends who leave at bedtime and drive while the kids sleep. I suppose this would maybe work for us if I could keep my eyes open past 8pm... and if we didn't have 3 little ones to care for once we arrived who would be well rested and ready to play while we hadn't caught any zzzzzzz.\n<h2>2.\u00a0 Love Your Lunchbox</h2>\nPack your kids(and yourself) a lunch and/or dinner in a lunch box\u00a0 along with a variety of \"rations\" (snacks).\u00a0 We used to just plan to stop along the way. During the year we usually don't visit fast food joints often, so our drive down was always the exception, however, we found that they hadn't really grown that fond of rest stop food. Packing lunches helps us to eat when we are hungry, and then grab an extra small fry on the ride if we're in the mood. Rationing out small snacks is also a great way to keep them busy throughout the ride as well.\n<h2>3.Border Bags</h2>\nWhen we first started traveling I was looking for ways to help \"reward\" the kids for their patience as well as keep them busy, so I came across the idea of giving kids something for each hour of the trip. Instead of this, I decided to put together paper baggies with goodies in them labeled with each state. I would alternate snacks, sometimes a movie, a little toy or one of the $3 or $4 small lego set etc. This helps them to witness/ experience the progress and are also great for learning about the different states they will pass through geographically on their way. This past time the older kids had tons of video games etc. and they really didn't need anything extra for the trip, so we filled plastic eggs with undisclosed amounts of cash. They got to pick an egg at each state. I think there was a total of like $7 for each of them, but they were excited to have a little cash to use at one of those rest stop candy or sticker machines.\n<h2>4. The need for rest stops is real</h2>\nWhen I was growing up our rest stops were always sparse. The name of the game was getting to our destination as quickly as possible. This, however, always caused me to be afraid to drink during the ride, for fear of needing to go #1 when a rest stop was still hours away. When we decided to travel, the first promise we made was to stop when someone needed a rest stop. Make it quick if it's just for the bathroom, and if you need a break and a stretch, take it slowly and take the 10-15 minutes to recharge.\n\nSpeaking of rest stops- also always try to estimate rest stop time into your ETA... your big kids are counting down the time and they will hold you to it.\u00a0 We always add a solid 3 hours to our GPS time when we have a 12 hour drive. They never complain if you arrive early.\n<h2>5. Don't Forget Flip Flops</h2>\nRegardless of the season, bring flip flops for everyone, especially the kids. First of all, if you plan to visit a pool when you get where you're going, you'll have to bring them anyway.\u00a0 For the drive, however, these are great for quick run ins to rest stops. I can't even tell you the amount of time we've spent shaking out blankets and pillows and digging through piles of crayons, markers, and video games to try to find socks and shoes buried beneath the ruins they'd been working on for the past 3 hours. If you're anti flip flop, then have them take off their shoes right when they get into the car and pack an extra pair of socks somewhere handy so you can get to them quickly at rest stops.\n<h2>6.Forget your screen time limits.</h2>\nWe set screen time limits for our kids, and it works great during the regular routines of our household, however, when it's a long drive like this, bring out the Ipad, DS, Movies etc. You are in survival mode.\n<h2>7. Keep essentials handy</h2>\nI can't tell you the number of times that we've accidentally thrown the bag with the dramamine and motrin in the trunk, which calls for a stop if someone needs something along the trip.\n\nInstead we now plan for motion sickness (keep dramamine, peppermint essential oils and beadlets, plastic bags and paper towels) handy.\u00a0 After this last trip, I'll also always pack some stinky spray with my favorite essential oils).We also make sure water and our other daily meds are within reach since we leave so early in the morning and don't usually take them until we're on the road.\n<h2>8. If you're traveling with a pacifier kid- bring extras!</h2>\nNot one extra... like 2 or 3 extra.\u00a0 In our experience, the pacifiers are used as an emotional warfare weapon against parents on the drive. When she doesn't want to be in the car anymore, she'll toss the pacifier \"overboard\" (meaning to the side of the car that no one can reach while we're driving). We always keep a few extra ones handy because once she's done tantruming she often wants a pacifier to calm down and we have a nice one handy.\n<h2>9. Cups with Lids</h2>\nFor our older kiddos we like to bring a travel mug with a straw in addition to their water bottles. This way we can put milk, juice or gingerale/gatorade (for sore tummys) with less of a chance of spills.\u00a0 If you have a real little one, fill one sippy cup with whatever they usually drink, but bring an extra one to keep handy too!\u00a0 Our littlest drinks milk in the morning, and it's not always convenient to rinse it out when we want to switch her over to water for the day.\n<h2>10. When all else fails, resort to bribery- your greatest wing-it-mom-weapon</h2>\nEspecially if you are like me and do not regularly engage in bribing your children, they perk right up and listen when they hear one fly out there.\u00a0 Ice cream when we get there... a donut at dunkin....5 bucks... whatever it takes.\n\n<strong>And if you're interested in doing a few simple things to keep your own sanity... here are 2 bonus tips because when mama ain't happy... ain't nobody happy!</strong>\n\n<em>* Treat yo'self - when you are packing your kids' lunches, don't forget to pack for you....and throw in some chocolate and salty chips, and gummy worms...and don't forget to stop at starbucks for that gingerbread ice latte that you love, the extra time added to your trip for that stop will be worth it.</em>\n\n<em>* Get intellectual with your navigator and listen while they read a book. If you are flying solo listen to an audiobook. Don't forget to pause and discuss newly gained knowledge. Here are a couple of the latest books we read Crucial Conversations and https://cliffordoravec.com/the-epic-guide-to-bootstrapping-a-startup and I even forced my family to listen to the audio book version of Becoming by Michelle Obama.</em>\n\n&nbsp;",

I take a longing look at my cup of coffee, knowing that whatever remains in my cup will cool and me microwaved probably 12 times before I finally give up and pour it down the drain because the hustle and bustle of the morning is about to begin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>... Ok , you caught me. The scenario I painted is truth about twice a week. The rest of the time my alarm wakes me up after hitting the snooze button 3 times and causes me to begrudgingly slide out of bed. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether I wake up with them or before them, I love to take a few minutes to breathe in a big hug, say good morning, and ask an important question. It's a question that sounds sort of silly because of the way we've made it a tradition of asking. It's a question that helps us to manage our expectations, help one another, and approach the day with purpose and positivity. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The question is...\"What's your best day?\" </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I know, it's not the clearest asked question, but it's the way we've chosen to ask it. No matter how you ask the question, the meaning behind it is the same. \"What would the best version of today look like.\"  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In these morning time conversations we're not talking about great big dreams (we save those conversations for other times, but we still do have those talks too).  These convos are about the day before us. Knowing the schedule, the obligations of the day, and our own desires, we talk out the best day.  Since I am a huge advocate of winging it, this does NOT always mean making a detailed plan. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The conversation often sounds like this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Me- \"Hey buddy. Morning! (insert big hug). So it's Monday. What's your best day?\" </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Kid- \"hmm.  Cheerios for breakfast, a calm day at school, and probably some drawing in the afternoon. What's your best day?\" </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Me- \"My best day is... talking to grandma a bit on the phone, doing a little bit of work, playing with Ellie, and snuggling with each of you for a little while tonight.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This quick check in conversation helps us to set some basic goals for the day, and also helps us to understand what each other's goals are. It also helps us to feel a sense of peace and accomplishment about the day. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's so simple, it's so basic, but I know each time we chat about this I have a pulse on what matters to my kids. Sometimes their best day includes hoping their friend is back to school after being sick for a day or two. Sometimes it's finishing a school project... and some snowy days its hanging out in PJS, playing a family game, and binge watching the office. I feel like it keeps us connected, and as a mom it helps me to sort of plan a bit and to know what to expect. For example... when my 7 year old has rock painting on his mind. I kind of prepare myself for that messy afternoon crafty time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Do things happen during the day that are NOT part of our best days? YES! Do we sometimes skip out on things that we intended to do? Yes!  But we roll with it!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the beginning we definitely had lots and lots of things on our best day list, but we've gotten pretty good at narrowing it down.  Even our two year old is getting super great at telling something she wants to do during the day as their best day.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Do we always every day without fail ask this question in the morning? Heck no. We are human. Sometimes time slips away. Sometimes someone's sick. And sometimes we don't check in until the afternoon when they get off the bus, but the cool thing is that often times even if we haven't said it out loud, we are still all thinking about having our best day!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think the key is that we're approaching our days with intention and the belief that today will be the best version of today.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So... what's your best day? Let me know!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

Then there are times when my kids are sick and the winging it that comes along with those times makes me feel all crumpled up inside.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This morning I found myself \"winging it\" when I had a day scheduled out and was awoken in the wee hours of the morning by a kiddo who is totally sick.  Instead of the leisurely stroll through the grocery store I had planned, I rushed through, forgot half of my items, and made it home just in time to bring him to the doctor ( Yes our doctor is amazing and met us at the office to check him out on a Saturday morning).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ok call me a worry wart. Call me a nervous nelly.  Call me neurotic... but when any my kids are sick I worry. And when my middle kiddo is sick... I sit around on edge like a ball of nerves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No, it's not because I play favorites. It's because he has the a word... asthma. Like really crappy sucky asthma. So sucky that it's become like a swear word in our house...</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To give a little context, let's pause and rewind back 5 years ago.  Here's what I \"knew\" about asthma.  My brother had asthma as a kid and sometimes when he ran around he needed an inhaler. I had read about kids dying of asthma and I imagined they didn't have their inhalers on hand or maybe they were alone and couldn't get help. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then, 4 years and 10 months ago, when my middle kiddo was 2 1/2,  he was diagnosed with asthma. I'll save his dramatic diagnosis story for another day, but let's just say we brought him to the ER thinking maybe he needed an inhaler and we were told that he was having a life threatening asthma attack and they hoped that the medicines would work. Scariest. Words. Ever. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since that day we've had numerous ambulance rides and emergency room visits. It's been a crazy scary journey because... breathing is kind of an important thing. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway being an asthma mom has come to mean jumping out of bed when I hear the \"rough coughs\" that sound like the beginning of something scary. I've purchased pulse oximeter just to be reassured that his body is getting the oxygen it needs. I'm paranoid of the coughs and sniffles of strangers because every runny nose can turn into a scary situation, sometimes before we even know he is sick. And right now as I write to you, I'm the mom who is curled up next to my  7 year old, wrapped up in a blanket after a breathing treatment obsessively checking his O2 sat as he dozes and fevers. And as soon as I am sure that he's ok, I'll sneak away and pack a hospital bag, just like I do every time I hear a cough or sneeze because things can change and go downhill so quickly. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am not writing this to get sympathy (for myself or my kiddo) although maybe sometimes we are deserving. I'm really writing this because I didn't know how scary asthma could be until I saw it in my own child. I've seen eye rolls of colleagues and family members when I stayed home from work to monitor his breathing. I've heard comments like \"doesn't he have an inhaler?\" from friends who just didn't know how serious asthma could be. I've felt like teachers and the school nurse probably think I'm just one of those parents who keeps their kids out of school for every little sniffle. So I figured it's worth a shot to share out into this world how much asthma sucks. Anyways, we all need a good vent session now and then.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For now, I'll be returning to my crumpled up state for the next several hours (hopefully not days) as we wait out this yucky bug, hoping we can stay home and not rush to the emergency room like so many times before because like I said before... Asthma sucks. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

I downloaded an app on my phone, synced my tiles, and now all I have to do is open the app and select to find my keys and they start chiming! The best part... it works in reverse too!

It was themed but still classy and we absolutely loved the play on the TWO with the snowflake!\n\nWhen you plan a party, there are a few different things to think about:\n<h1>Food</h1>\nThis was one of our biggest challenges. Once I pick a theme I struggle and mull over ways to connect it back to our theme somehow. After much searching and chatting with friends... tossing ideas around... here are the snacks, main dishes, and desserts we came up with!\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-250\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_20190209_110157.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"297\" /><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-251\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_20190209_111353.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"222\" height=\"295\" />\n\nWe had frozen themed snacks from a snowy day dip, to cold cut sandwiches!\n\nI put the snacks out in the main living room, and we put all the lunch foods in the dining room.\n\nSnacks:\n\nSnowman/ Olaf noses- Cheese puffs\n\nSnowballs-\u00a0 Smartfood Cheddar Popcorn\n\nSnow Day Chips and Dip-\n\nSven Snacks\n\nOlaf Arms\n\nLunch Items:\n\n*Cold Cut Sandwiches\n\n*Chilly\n\n*Snow Day Pasta Salad\n\n*Ice Berg Salad\n\n*Snow Covered Salad\n\n*Snowman Sandwiches\n<h1>Decorations</h1>\nWe stuck with blue and white snowflake theme. I got a sheet of blue glitter tulle to lay on top of the white tablecloth on the cake/dessert table to make it extra fancy!\n\nWe also got\u00a0 balloon sticks because the party store near us was having some sort of helium issue. I just put the balloon sticks in glasses from the dollar store with those little gems inside (which we've even used during our penguin and polar bear learning weeks).\u00a0 I like this idea because a little baggie of balloons is cheap and we put these away to reuse for future parties!\n\nAt the last minute I got this white Wilton cupcake stand. I got some glitter cardstock and cut one inch strips of paper and attached it around the cupcake holder. After Christmas I got some of these little clear snowflakes at the dollar store for 1/2 off. I just hot glued one on the front. I used leftover materials for the utensil holder for the food table as well.\n\nWe also got some cute little hangy snowflake twirly things for the ceiling which made her very happy. We put those in the living room and kitchen area where the activities were.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the decoration process was the tags that were really a part of labeling the food.",

There's a reason for the saying \"Out of the mouths of babes.\" They see the world in a really neat way, and sometimes the realizations they bring to the table as they learn can help us to reflect upon the things we have, for some reason or another, come to accept as fact.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Story time: Last night, while reading Harry Potter with my kiddos, my 11 year old said \"You know that's why they say 'People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones!\" I immediately nodded in agreement and even said \"That's right!\"... when suddenly my 7 year old had a confused look on his face. He thought for just a moment and said \"Actually Mommy, people in regular houses shouldn't throw stones either.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Think about that for a moment. It's ok... take your time...it took me a moment to absorb too... but he's freaking right!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I sat in bed last night and as I went through my day today those words kept coming back to me again and again, so I think I'm ready for my sappy soapbox.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It makes sense, the original saying, right? After all it means that if you're guilty of saying or behaving a certain way, perhaps you shouldn't be so quick to criticize others.  Seems like common sense.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But think about it... what if we spent less time deciding who was entitled to throw which stones at who and just stopped throwing them? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think judgement is part of our nature, right? I mean after all it protects us from dangerous situations and helps us to make decisions about which adventures to pursue and who we'd like to spend the journey with. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Throwing stones isn't really about judgement though. Throwing stones is about attacking... and that's a lot different than judging a situation and making a decision on your own about it.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It just got me thinking that maybe before I throw stones, I'd better stop to think not about what my house is made of... but if that stone would better serve a different purpose... a stepping stone? A gardens stone? A kindness stone?  A building stone? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After all if instead of throwing our stones, we all put them together... imagine the mountains and kingdoms we could build (Ok ok I'm getting a little too sappy even for myself... time to step down off that soap box).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My littles have definitely got me thinking, and I am betting by now that they've got you thinking too. :-)  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

We did both the marbling and the regular old dyeing method with the vinyl on.

Well almost full... my husband hasn't totally jumped on board with the whole thing yet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It started with my (now) 11 year old. He has been a Harry Potter fan for years. He began reading the books in second and third grade and I'll never forget the look on his face the night he finished the series. He had stayed up until midnight (unbeknownst to us) and had been reading by the light of a flashlight. He wandered into our room with tears in his eyes like he needed someone to share the  moment with.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first 5 books he read were from a box set I received for Christmas the year the first 5 books had been released that way. I wanted them so badly... read the first three chapters and then set it aside.  I held onto them, always meaning to read them, and was glad when I could pass them along to him to enjoy.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'll confess I did watch the first few movies, but I think because I hadn't experienced the journey of the story through the book, they were good, but didn't make me a big Potter fan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This year we decided to schedule a big trip to Universal Studios mostly because of my oldest's love of all things HP.  I thought it would be fun to read the stories with my kiddos, knowing my 7 year old with be my main audience as he experienced the books for the first time... and something happened... I fell in love with Harry Potter.  Not just the character but the whole story. I'll make another brief confession, we're only on book 3... but we are moving along bedtime storytime by bedtime storytime. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Last year my parents and younger sisters went to Universal and said that the Harry Potter part was amazing... but they had never read the books OR even watched the movies.  After some investigation into the parts of Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley that Universal has recreated, we decided they needed to see at least the first movie before they go back again this year.... and our Harry Potter Watch Party was born.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We really made preparing for this party a three day event with activities, arts and crafts, and decorating. So whether you're throwing a Harry Potter birthday party, classroom party, or you're just looking for some fun HP themed activities, check out these ones we used for our party!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This post contains affiliate links.

Then we added layers of hot glue around the top of them to make different styles of handles. I handed this off fo the kiddos to do and they had SUCH a fun time! I helped them make swirls of hot glue around the bottom of the wand and when they were done, we used some craft paint to add the colors.

The whole episode was about what to say and not to say to parents of children with special needs. It was great podcast episode and I really recommend that you listen to it for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>As I digested the content, it got me wondering... <strong><em>Are there similar things you shouldn't say to a mom?</em> </strong>Especially a mom you don't really know well? Like a mom you meet at the grocery store, or a stranger, or even someone you used to work with years ago?</p>\n<p>And so, I went on a journey to compile this working list (which I'm open to adding to by the way) As part of the process of compiling this list... I went through the quite cathartic, laughter inducing, and camaraderie building process of chatting with some of my favorite groups online friends (one of them being our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wingitmom/\">WingItMom</a> page).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So here it is... the first edition of the \"Things I'd highly suggest not saying to a mom you meet at the grocery store\" list. Of course this list applies to more than grocery store interactions, but you know what I'm talking about, it's when you see a mom that you don't know, sort of know, or are just getting to know.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Are you having any more children?</h2>\n<p>Ok this one is especially bad when the person then eyes your post Thanksgiving gut and you know they're probably really wondering if you're currently pregnant (or maybe that's all in my mind)...\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>\"Are you going to try again for a boy/ girl.\"</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Did the sex of my current child/ children offend you? Did I miss the mark by producing my current child(ren)? It's such a bizarre question to answer. I never did personally care about the sex of my children, but if I did, would this comment be helpful in that case either?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<h2>\"Is he/she yours?\" or \"Are they all yours?\"</h2>\n<p>Questioning whether children belong to a person is kind of a weird thing to do. It puts the mom in a weird position, it's going to get you a quick yes/ no answer, maybe a dirty look, and really won't fill any sort of purpose. I had people ask me this a lot when I had my first son because he was blonde and I have dark hair and brown eyes, but I carried that kiddo for 9 long months, went through grueling labor to have a C section, then woke up with him night after night, I didn't really appreciate a stranger questioning my maternity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, consider this... most people don't go pick up other people's children to take shopping for fun. If they do, they probably don't have time to stop and talk anyone, or they are a little crazy and will probably claim to be the child's mom any way (yes I know people who have done this sort of crazy bologna).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<h2>\"That's why I don\u2019t have kids.\u201d</h2>\n<p>This comment really is just a weird backhanded insult to a person's child(ren). Even if this mom's kids are currently driving her nuts.. there is a good chance you're going to meet her mama bear side when you make comments like these.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Additionally... just think, what if a random mom walked up to you at the store and said, \"See, that's why you don't have kids?\" ...Ouch...</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<h2>\"You sure have your hands full.\"</h2>\n<p>We could also go with the cute \"coffee mug quote worthy\" rebuttal \"If you think our hands are full, you should see our hearts.\", but the comment really just implies that a mom isn't handling things well.\u00a0 If she's not managing well, chances are she already knows it and is trying to flee the store/ situation as quickly as possible. Get out of her way.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<h2>\"Cherish every moment\" or \"You're going to miss this\"</h2>\n<p>You guys, we all cry about how much our kids are growing and how time is stealing these moments away from us... first of all, we don't need to be reminded. Second there are things I miss about having tiny babies, and there are things I definitely do not miss AT ALL. I do NOT miss middle of the night feedings. I do NOT miss being pregnant. I do NOT miss poopy diapers. I just don't.\u00a0</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<h2>\"Where are his/her shoes/ socks/ coat?\"</h2>\n<p>They are in the place where shoes, socks, and coats live... which is probably a basket of unfolded laundry in my bedroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In all seriousness when it comes to coats, it's not practical to unbuckle your child, and then stand in the cold to wrestle them into their jacket. It's literally quicker to grab them and run into the store.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, let's talk about the sockless, shoeless child... let me explain what has probably happened to this parent. Snuggle up, it's story time!</p>\n<p>Let's call the hypothetical child Lucy. Lucy does not like shoes and socks. She takes them off at least a dozen times before leaving the front door.\u00a0 As soon as she's big enough to crawl, not only does she take them off, she seems to hide them on opposite sides of the house as mom is scrambling to find her car keys and throw a granola bar in her purse. Lucy then takes her shoes and socks off in the car. One of the socks is wedged between the seats. When Mom reaches her hand in she is met with something sticky, but she grabs the sock, wipes her hands on her leggings, and tries to wrestle the shoes and socks onto Lucy's feet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lucy then takes them off in the store.\u00a0 Twice, she throws them at her mom, four times she drops them into the lower part of the shopping cart, and then just as Mom gets to check out, she discovers that one of those darn shoes is missing. Mom now has to spend 27 minutes scouring the floor of every aisle looking for said shoe. She rounds the corner of the toothpaste aisle to see an elderly man accidentally kick the shoe far under the aisle rack. Said shoe is gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After experiencing this Groundhog Day sort of phenomenon weekly (at least) over the course of several months, several pairs of socks and , and even attempts at some tricks she saw on Pinterest to keep socks and shoes on... Mom decides this child is meant to be shoeless.</p>\n<p>As you can see, this was a decision probably not taken lightly, but rather with the seriousness of\u00a0 a parent choosing sanity over shoes.\u00a0 Give her a break.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>If you relate to any of these\u00a0 (or have something you think I just have to add) let me know in the comments!</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Oh... and I know... you are probably left thinking:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"But wait... What about the ridiculous things my Uncle Larry says at Thanskgiving? Or how about the rude passive aggressive comments from my mother in law Gertie? And what about my know it all cousin Irene? They say things that really get under my skin!\"</p>\n<p>Well don't you worry, that post is a whole different beast... and it's coming soon, so stay tuned!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

Here's a <a href=\"https://buynothingproject.org/\">link to the organizations page in case you want to check it out. </a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The main concept behind this project is that community members give and receive freely in a group.  There are no strings attached, so if you have something to give that you no longer need, you post it and people who are interested can share that they'd like it. You gift to whoever you choose, using whatever method you choose. Additionally, if you are in need of something you can post as well, and if anyone in your community has one to gift, they can pass it along your way!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The discovery and development of this group in my town was almost perfect timing as it came right after our first purge of items after watching Marie Kondo.  I wished that we had the group sooner because I knew how much I had gotten rid of , and how many people could have benefited. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Here are some amazing ways it's changed our lives:<br></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Giving feeds the soul</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is such great positive energy attached to giving freely. I almost feel bad about how much I enjoy it myself as the \"giver\". The best part of that positive energy is that it doesn't just spread, it grows!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>It saves our stuff from landfills</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have saved so many things from the trash by giving them new life. Sometimes we have something that is broken and we don't know how to fix, but we are able to pass it along to someone who DOES know how to fix it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>It saves us money.... a lot of it!</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are so many little things we come across that we need which are added expenses to our household. With this group, I have been able to receive so many things we have needed or wanted including an outdoor playhouse for our daughter,  a new dining room table and chairs, a new tea party table, party supplies, snowpants and snow boots for my kids (I mean they outgrow them so quickly and they're super pricey!), and even a whole wardrobe of size 3 clothing.  The think I'm looking forward to most is gifting many of these things again when my kiddos outgrow them!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>We have found some really cool things</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of my most recent finds was a Dreamsicle tea party figurine. When I was little I used to collect those things religiously from a store called Noah's in our local mall. Anytime I got money for my birthday, I went right there! And now I have a little tea party figure to give to my girl! I also found a jewelry box a local friend had stored for years. It's the EXACT same one I had when I was a little girl! I can't wait to give it to my daughter when she's a little older and more careful. That's priceless!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>It defeats the lack mindset</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here's the really cool thing... when you begin to give and then receive the things you need, there's this sort of feeling that there's enough in this world. I used to kind of hoard things away because one day I might need something. Now I realize that if I give away this bag of random art supplies to someone who can use them now, I can probably ask for the random thing I am looking for down the road and chances are someone might have it to gift away!  As more people begin to see the kinds of things people are willing to give away, they become more likely to give themselves, realizing that this is a group of generosity!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>It's not just about stuff, it's about community</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here's the cool thing, not only do you get to meet, chat, and share with members of your community, but there's a huge opportunity to help others. I've seen people go to help a woman who had a tree come down on her fence. Someone had help getting their siding fixed on the side of the house. We had a chair that was in rough shape, a gentleman offered to fix it up if anyone had fabric. Someone else donated fabric, he was able to fix the chair and then gift it to someone who needed it! It's truly about working together.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"> <img class=\"wp-image-415\" style=\"width: 450px;\" src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Toddler-PREK-Color-purple.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have especially seen, right before my eyes, the good in our community.

I'm working to do this in a manageable and well rounded way, and I kept thinking that I just need to share what I can about this experience with you. One of the things I've been thinking about is the way that it can feel super overwhelming to have the responsibilities of a home and trying to plan activities.

I officially have a threenager! This little gal loves mermaids and pirates and Spiderman and Elsa. She is such a well rounded kiddo, in part because her two bigger brothers have bestowed upon her the toys that they don't want to play with, but aren't quite ready to get rid of yet.  Either way she loves it, so when she asked for a mermaid party but said she also wanted pirates, I was in love with the idea! Upon some browsing, brainstorming, and searching, I was able to find some mermaid things, and some pirate ideas online, but it was tricky to find both, so I thought it was worth sharing here!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While we don't necessarily constrict our kids to gender normed themes, we also understand that the truth is lots of girls are into things like mermaids, but a mermaid party might not be AS fun for some of the boys in our lives, so this theme also balanced those interests well (although both the boys and girls seemed to enjoy all the activities!) </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Before I get started I have to mention that this post contains affiliate links.

Our hearts swelled and stretched with a joy and love we didn't know we could add to our already joyful and loving lives. Our little Ellie is the perfect blend of sweet and sassy. She is a maker of really big messes, and a super duper helper! She thinks she is a grown up, but when we're at the toy store sometimes says she's still a baby. She can do everything all by herself and she is such a good mommy to her many many dolls and stuffed animal friends. She wants to be a doctor and a vet and a mommy and a superhero when she grows up (I'm convinced she can do all of these things). She also wants to be a mermaid and while I'm not sure about that exactly, I'm not ruling it out. She loves to snuggle and wants desperately to know how to read and write. While she likes to watch Mickey \"rascals\" (aka old school Mickey cartoons), Outdaughtered \"the Busby's\", and Bluey... She'd much rather be at library storytime, art class, or Zumbini. She looks forward to doing lots of projects at home, and going shopping with her pocketbook. She makes us a perfect party of five and she fills our lives with so much love and laughter and now she is officially a threenager.<br>Happy 3rd birthday to our sweet Eliana Marie.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You guys... This is a real talk post. This is a real life struggle post, but I know I can't be alone in feeling the way I do!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the past year or so, I have been doing journaling in my Start Today journal (shoutout to Rachel Hollis for this one!). I divide the \"10 dreams\" section into big audacious dreams and then some daily value practices that will never be \"finished\" or \"checked off\" but that I feel like they are central enough for me to write them every single day.  One of the things I write in my journal as a daily practice is that I practice patience every day. Another thing I write is \"I am an awesome mom.\" </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So every day I jump out of bed ready to make the day awesome - ok. fine. I roll out of bed, rub my eyes for a minute, do an extra stretch and then stumble downstairs to start brewing my cup of coffee. But still, I have the feeling that the day is going to be awesome. I write in my journal and set my intention for the day. I just KNOW that I am going to be so patient and the most awesome mom. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> And then I do it! I am awesome! I make sure lunches are made. I enjoy a morning chat. I prepare breakfasts of oatmeal and cheerios and pancakes, or whatever's on their minds. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I send them out the door. Sometimes this is honestly not so patiently, but I'm working on it. I mean... get your freaking shoes on kid... and if you miss the bus, you're busted (Our fancy term for \"forget the screen time tonight\").  Every morning as they leave the house I tell them \"Be good, be kind, have your best day.\" I imagine in my most sentimental moments that they'll look back on that little mantra fondly as grown ups, just like I remember my mom saying \"Jennaboo, Rise and Shine. It's a school day!\" </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway I won't bore you with the details of the day, but I mom really hard all day long. I paint and playdough, I library story hour and Zumbini, I visit with friends and run errands. I read stories and play the princess cupcake game. I just have this feeling around 3 pm that's something like \"Wow I'm doing it. I'm being an awesome mom.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>... and then 3 becomes 4. My energy begins to dwindle. My patience begins to thin. Especially on nights when my husband is working late in the office, there is no relief from my exhaustion. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The confession- around 6pm (right after dinner), I am not super mom anymore. I start counting down the time till bedtime. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sure we have fun moments. I enjoy quiet moments with my two older kiddos. We're currently reading Danny The Champion of the World by Roald Dahl snuggled up in my mama bear chair at night.  I look forward to my oldest reading me a \"sweet nothing\" fact from his daily calendar every night. I know these three kiddos know how deeply they are loved and how surely they belong here... but that awesome energy from the day has evaporated. The hop in my step has faded to a slump in my chair. The fuel tank is on E. I feel like I suck. The mom guilt sneaks in which probably just makes my patience shorter and makes me feel worse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have been trying to talk to myself like I would talk to a friend (advice from a Brene Brown book I recently read)... so I'll end on this note. If I was reading this very post, or hearing these very words I've written here tonight from a friend I wouldn't tell her she sucks for being tired. I wouldn't tell her that she needs to be awesomer... I'd say \"Girl you are an amazing mom. Being awesome and feeling awesome are two different things! Even when you feel like you begin to fall apart those babies love you deeply and you feel all together to them. You're doing a great job.\" I hope I'm right.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

Let the teacher, school, and district provide the instruction for your child. Even if they are technically schooling from home, let their teacher lead the way. Sure, help if needed (and in the early days working out the technology kinks will surely require more of our attention), but don't assume that you're going to be required to provide curriculum to your child. The teachers are working to figure that part out!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can ask for help</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You are allowed to ask for help. You are allowed not to know it all. If you can't figure out how to do something, submit an assignment, access a website... ask the teacher. It has never been easier to send an e-mail to a teacher. The number of messages I've seen on social media from parents near and far complaining about teachers and the technology, I'm shocked that very few have reached out to ask. Just ask! It will do you, the teacher, and your child a favor!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your child has a chance to rise to the occasion</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes in their lives, our kids are offered opportunities to be empowered. They are offered an opportunity to figure things out. This sort of productive struggle can be super good for them! I bet some of your stress about your child logging in, completing assignments etc can be resolved with just giving them the task and having them work through it. Kids are amazing. They can accomplish great things. Instead of getting mad and stressed, notice the great things they are capable and just how strong they are!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your child is allowed to be wrong (so back off a bit)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the major things I see parents worried about is that they don't neccessarily know the content and the way the content is currently taught in schools (think Common Core).  The great news is that your child's teacher is still the teacher....and if your child doesn't understand after the content is delivered, it's ok for them to be wrong. If you think that your child gets every question correct at school... well this is a great reality check! The questions and assignments students struggle with are a great indicator to teachers about what they need to continue to teach, or maybe even approach a different way.  Help if you can, but there is no reason for your child to be perfect during this time. Basically.... leave your kid alone and let them do their work when you can. That's how their teachers will know what they have learned.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No one is shaking an iron fist.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Understand that a lot of the pressure both teachers and parents are putting on themselves is self imposed. I have received only supportive and understanding e-mails from teachers. We all are ready to give each other grace during this time. No one is standing by waiting for you to screw up as a parent. We're all just doing our best. So take a deep breath and relax. Everything is going to be just fine!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And to wrap things up, listen, I know this sucks and this is a pain. It's not the way we all want things to be. We want normal. We want our kids to be able to play with one another at the playground, and sit at morning meeting with their teachers... but here we are in this reality, so let's just go with it.  Have an extra glass of wine, or go for a jog. Know that this time is stressful and it's ok, but don't let this school thing be the bane of your existence when it doesn't have to be.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

I've been preparing for some of the Easter themed fun that will ensue in the week ahead, and I thought I'd share with you some of my favorite Easter projects we've done over the years all using plastic eggs!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This post contains affiliate links.

For young children, even matching the color and sizes of the two different parts can be a fun task.  As your children grow, changing up the tasks can be fun too. Consider using a sharpie to write uppercase letters on one half of the egg, and lowercase letters on another, you could also match with shapes, and even math equations where children can match to the answer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Egg Hunt</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course kids love going on egg hunts. Usually at our house around Easter, the eggs are full of goodies and cash! But if you wanted to do several different egg hunts here are some ways to make them a little bit more creative.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead of hiding treats in the eggs, consider writing down a message letter by letter. As they find the eggs they have to try to decode/ unscramble the letters to solve the message.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You could also do another type of hunt where they can have a sheet of paper (maybe with a math problem, letter, shape - whatever skill you want to work on) and the solutions are hidden in the eggs. As they find the eggs they have to write the answer in the missing spot. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Egg Prints</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a super fun painting project. It's even more fun if you have different sizes of eggs. All you need to do is put some paint in some paper plates or as shallow dish, and then use the eggs to make different shaped circles. If you want this project to be fancier, you can even use acrylic or craft paint on canvas. If you allow the colors to dry in between steps you can get a really cool effect. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another fun thing to do would be to put a piece of vinyl in the shape of an egg or bunny on your canvas before painting. Once you've finished your egg prints and remove the vinyl, you'll see the outline of the shape you chose.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you don't want to get too messy, you could also trace the eggs with different colors depending on the age of your children. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Egg Sensory Play</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These eggs work as awesome sensory play instruments. I like to use them with playdough, kinetic sand, and even water or rice. They are great for filling, making shapes, or using as \"cookie cutters\" as your kiddos play. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Egg Creatures</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Use a plastic egg to create a creature. You can use pipe cleaners, googly eyes, feathers, yarn or pretty much any craft supply you have hanging around to make little creatures or people.  Glue dots worked best for me since I was worried hot glue might melt the eggs and liquid glue is just trickier to manage.  I bet small pieces of tape would work too!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Scavenger Hunt</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":493} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/plastic-eggs.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-493\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This activity is actually an all season activity for our family. My 8 year old LOVES designing scavenger hunts for our family. The eggs are a perfect thing to be \"Searching \" for and the clue to the location of the next egg is easily tucked inside. Depending on the age of your children you could either design the scavenger hunt and have them be the \"seekers\" or you could have them design it and the grown ups go on the hunt!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Egg Shakers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":494} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://wingitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/plastic-eggs-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-494\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you're feeling musical, you could try making some egg shakers. Explore which materials inside give the best \"shake\". Different kinds of beans, popcorn, rice, pebbles, and sand are all good options (FYI sand doesn't work well in the ones with little holes on the ends). As always, be cautious about the age of your child potential choking hazards! I was able to superglue eggs shut, but I still would definitely watch a young child closely with these!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

Of course, the aunties (like me!) and grandparents are so so excited to welcome the little baby boy. We had big plans for a bear themed baby shower. Little washcloths to be folded as bear favors were purchased. Menus were being planned. Games were in the works... and \"Stay at home\" orders happened. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It became increasingly clear that our May 3 baby shower was NOT going to be happening. When our venue canceled it sealed the deal. While we totally understand, we were super bummed. So we began the process of pivoting. How could we make this time super special for them? How could we make memories and have a place to share their baby registry so guests could shower the parents to be?  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The answer was clear. The answer to ALL things right now is... let's get virtual! So our virtual baby shower was born. There were no pinterest road maps, so I knew that I needed to share my own! I bet these ideas can help connect people for baby showers who are apart for other reasons in the future, beyond this crisis!  I have designed these graphics and you are welcome to use them for your own virtual baby shower should you be in the same boat as us!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before I get into the posts, here is how we set it up:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I created a Facebook Group, since the events are currently limited to 14 days, and I wanted the parents to be able to go back and see the things that people posted in the group in the future. In the \"About\" section of the group I added a little welcome message and a link to their baby registry.  I then added the grandparents, and parents to be, and we started inviting people to join. I had a goal to post about once a day and to balance \"Game\" posts with other feedback/interaction posts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here's the schedule we used for posts.

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These past several weeks have not always been \"easy\". I mean, our family hasn't gone through any major tragedy. We both still have jobs, and we have our health and one another. The thing we have lost is our regular routine that helps us manage the day, our tasks, and expectations. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I, personally, find it exhausting to act like the personal assistant or servant of my children, at their beck and call every moment of the day. Having a 12, 8, and 3 year old, their needs and the urgency of those needs vary, but I was exhausted for not having a moment to just exist! I was fighting from the minute I got out of bed to get the kids on task. I had virtually no time for my own work, and my glass was empty! Have I mentioned that my husband works from home (all the time) and he sucks at making it to meetings, so I already act as a secretary for him making sure I'm hounding him about getting to meetings every day. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During spring break we did all sorts of fun things and even though we were stuck at home, both my husband and I took the week off of work. We had a little time to read a good book, catch up on work in the garden, and enjoy our children without the stress and pressure of day to day stuff.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it was time to get back to work and school this week,  I decided to start the day with 3 things that have immensely helped us to manage the day, and have lightened my load as the days have gone by.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This post contains affiliate links.

In fact, I have often posted a picture of lunchboxes on the last day of the school year to commemorate the fact that I don't have to pack lunches for the whole summer. It was one of the small upsides to the whole distance learning thing. But then my kids were coming to me hungry at all times of day asking for lunch.  Packing lunches has helped me to answer all the \"mom I am hungry\" comments with \"check your lunch box\". It's like I don't need to manage their food needs the rest of the daytime and it's definitely worth it. I also just need to share about our favorite lunchbox <a href=\"https://www.nurturenestct.com/product-page/re-play-snack-stack\">organizing containers </a>(since we're really trying to cut down on disposable plastic bags). These containers are fun, dishwasher safe, and they are so easy to use when packing lunches or snacks!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Plan their chores-</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every day I tell my kids they'll need to do some chores before they get screen time. The problem is that they finish school activities at all different times and then they're hounding me for which chores they need to do in order to play. Sometimes I'm in the middle of working, or washing dishes, and it's just another overwhelm for me. Instead, I've started planning and posting their chores on the door in the kitchen first thing in the morning. This helps them to know what's expected, it helps me to know which chores will be done (so I don't break my back trying to clean up after everyone), and it keeps them independent with transitioning and being held accountable for chores.

I am honestly just as effective and motivated to be productive in my comfy clothes. However, it turns out my kids aren't. Beginning last week, we decided to make our kids get dressed and brush their teeth first thing in the morning. This seems to help something click in their brains.

I guess it's time to do something now.\" This small routine has really changed the overall mood and attitude in our house throughout the day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Don't get me wrong, things aren't perfect around here, and we're definitely having rough days.

    "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A couple summers ago my husband was invited to a bachelor party in a town about an hour away.  I didn't want him to drive home, but I also am one who LOVES stays in hotels, so we booked a hotel in our state, dropped him off at the bachelor party venue, and I took the kids out to a restaurant and to the hotel pool. We really made a night of it.  The next morning we found a breakfast spot and drove past a movie theater, arcade, and bowling alley. That was the first time we considered how we could vacation right in our own state.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our summers are usually filled with weekly trips to 6 flags, science centers, zoos, childrens museums, movie theaters, aquarium... pretty much everywhere you can think of.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With travel quarantines, restrictions, and social distancing measures, we're getting even closer to home this summer with our \"vacationing\".  We're also saving a bunch of money. No, it's not exactly the same, but it feels great anyway! </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here are a few things we've done:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1.Pack a suitcase and vacation to the living room! </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We even set up air mattresses for everyone. We pretended it was our own hotel room. That was a super fun event, In fact we loved it so much that we decided to make \"sleepover Saturday\" a weekly event. My three year old was the cutest. She packed all on her own and did a great job: A pair of jammies, toothbrush, teddy bear, and a bedtime story! </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. Beach Day Getaway:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have been visiting local beaches (early in the morning before the crowds). Something about starting the day in the sand is perfect.

Pokemon Go Park Adventures</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have also been doing one of these every week and the kids love it. We go to local parks and they play Pokemon Go. We take breaks for hide and seek when the park is empty.

Lazy day</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Who doesn't like a good old fashioned Lazy Day? This is the kind of day where I let the kids watch TV, movies, video games, anything really. We all wear PJs (except my husband when he has work calls) and just chill out all day. We read books...it's just like we were at our own resort.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5.Fancy Friday </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes vacation calls for fancy dinners. For this reason we've had a few Fancy Friday dinners. I made the kids sparkling cider and pink lemonade drinks. We all dress up in fancy clothes and sit together and have a candlelight dinner.

Back Yard Play at Grammas</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While we have been super duper cautious about gathering anywhere in public or with others, we have begun to get together with my immediate family since we're all pretty much following the same distancing precuations.

Camp out!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We actually booked a full week camping in an RV at a local campground. I can't wait to actually get away, but it's as far from home as we're going. That's the big hoorah for our summer.

I couldn't bear the thought of another bummer summer, so we decided to make the most of it! We're only a couple weeks in, but we're absolutely loving it so far! Do you have any ideas?
