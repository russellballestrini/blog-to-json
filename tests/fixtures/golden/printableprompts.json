    "title": "The Phonics Dance - Magic!",
    "content": "When I was moved to teach first grade, I knew the most difficult part of teaching young readers was going to be teaching them to decode. I had taught first graders before, and the phonics instruction was boring and I often saw very little application to my students' reading and decoding.\n\nI went to a graduate studies workshop where a presenter shared about The Phonics Dance, created by Ginny Dowd. I was hooked immediately- and now, so are my students!\n\nAre you ready for some phonics magic?\n\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What is The Phonics Dance?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The phonics dance is a series of chants, visuals, motions, and stories used to teach students letter sounds. I use the \"Hunks and Chunks\" portion of the phonics dance in my first grade classroom. This portion concentrates on teaching students common vowel digraphs, diphthongs, and even some blends.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To really get an idea of what the phonics dance is... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOmEoo08sC8\">click here to see Ginny Dowd's class in action</a>. \u00a0I was immediately excited after seeing and hearing about the phonics dance, and knew that at very least, this would be an academic movement break.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Learning the Phonics Dance</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On the very first day of school, we practiced the letter sounds using the picture, word, sound cards that my students used in Kindergarten. By the fourth day of school, I introduced the \"ch\" brothers, th,ch, sh. \u00a0I added 1-3 chunks per week every week. Each time, introducing a story and then the chant that the students would practiced. \u00a0Every single morning, sometimes twice a morning, we practice the chunk \"dance\" or series of chunks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">What I noticed after just the first week was that already in our morning message my students' hands would shoot up and they would be eager to share \"I see a chunk!\" We quickly began to put a rectangle around the chunks we knew and circles around the words we knew. I was definitely optimistic at this time since no prompting had happened, my students were spotting these chunks on their own.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After the three \"h\" digraphs, I went right to the \"ing\" ending since it appears so frequently in their reading and writing. Learning this chunk also makes so many words manageable (not only sing, sting, ring, but also reading, jumping, seeing, going).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I decided in my classroom on the order to introduce the chunks based on student needs and reading material. (for example: the \"or\" chunk was taught when we were reading about a scarecrow and the words \"worn\" and \"torn\" appeared). I also marked down basic notes during reading group about some of the chunks that were giving the children the most trouble when they were decoding.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Magic?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Although I was excited about teaching phonics using the phonics dance, I also never could have imagined how it has helped my students to decode. Using \"chunks\" is the one strategy that they always employ independently. Those long words don't seem so long to segment and blend when you've got a chunk in there -think about the word Halloween (H-all-ow-ee-n), the words are just so much more manageable once the students have internalized these chunks. Vowel sounds are also something that first graders in the past have really struggled with. Often times, short vowels are expected to be \"mastered\" before long vowels can be taught. The problem is, that fairly early in reading, long vowel digraphs appear in reading. The phonics dance has given my students a way to access these long vowel digraphs in a fun way that really sticks with them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">What about the struggling readers who don't know all their letter sounds? What about the kids who struggle to segment and blend? Well this strategy has been a gift to them as well! Think about the word \"going\" instead of \"g-o-i-n-g\" there are only 2 parts \"go-ing\").</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Can you imagine first graders (in the fall) beginning to use long vowel spelling patterns in their writing? The most wonderful question one of my firsties asked me last week was \"Does feed have \"ee\" or \"ea\" in it). \u00a0Last year I taught third grade and those students were not as aware of vowel digraphs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Yes! Magic!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I am telling you, I feel like I've really found a piece of magic!rents love it (yes they are reciting the chunks at the dinner table), the students love it (\"When can we learn a new chunk?\"). and I love it (They can READ and WRITE!).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>",

    "title": "8 Ideas for Winter Sight Word Fun!",
    "content": "&nbsp;\n\nAs I am planning for all the fun winter activities ahead, I am reminded of those sight words. Kids seem to get tired of them so quickly, probably because we spend so much time on them. One thing that seems to get kids reengaged with sight words is offering them in a different theme (yes, we all know the snowman picture or picture of a Christmas tree does peak the interest).\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_77\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"224\"]<a href=\"http://www.teachersnotebook.com/product/PrintablePrompts/sight-word-fun-k-1-winter-theme\"><img class=\"wp-image-77 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/page-016-224x300.png\" alt=\"K-1 Dolch Sight Word Cards &amp; Activities. http://blog.printableprompts.com/8-ideas-for-winter-sight-word-fun/\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a> Dolch Sight Word Cards K-1![/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI recently created a set of winter themed Pre Primer, Primer, and Grade 1 \"flash cards\" and am brainstorming some of the ways I am going to use them in my classroom. Here are 8 ways I might use them!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Flash cards on a ring- good old strategy- nothing new. I print them on cardstock, attach them to a ring and give the \"focus\" ones to students who need practice. What I also like to do is give them a sticker on the back of the card for each day they read it correctly. I buy those shiny star stickers that are cheap and easy to use. Once they have read the word enough times to have one of each color star (there are 5 colors), I add a new word. Again, introducing the winter theme ones seems to re-excite them about this process!\n\n2.Word Wall- If you choose to use a \"sight word\" word wall, this would be a great place to use these words.\n\n3.Sight Word Match!- When I made these cards I used 6 different designs with an even number of pages, meaning you can print (preferably on cardstock and laminate) the set right for your students, and play a memory game. Read the sight words, and if the pictures match, you keep the pair! This is great for a center game!<a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Sight-Word-Fun-K-1-Winter-Theme-1619022\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/page-038-224x300.png\" alt=\"K-1 Dolch Sight Word Cards &amp; Activities. http://blog.printableprompts.com/8-ideas-for-winter-sight-word-fun/\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n4.Sight Word Walk- Print (preferably on cardstock) laminate, and hang around the room. Students walk around with their paper and a clipboard and write all the words they can find/read\n\n.<a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Sight-Word-Fun-K-1-Winter-Theme-1619022\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-79 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sightwordwalk-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"K-1 Dolch Sight Word Cards &amp; Activities. http://blog.printableprompts.com/8-ideas-for-winter-sight-word-fun/\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n5.Sight Word Scavenger Hunt- Print and hang the cards around the room (just like for sight word walk). Give students a particular job when recording words. For example: find words that have an a in them. This activity also helps students look through words, and gives them lots of exposure to sight word reading. You can also change the \"finding\" job to get students completing this activity again and again! These are some of my favorite center or even morning work tasks.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Sight-Word-Fun-K-1-Winter-Theme-1619022\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/page-030-224x300.png\" alt=\"K-1 Dolch Sight Word Cards &amp; Activities. http://blog.printableprompts.com/8-ideas-for-winter-sight-word-fun/\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n6.Sight Word Race- Give each student a different card, or have students choose a card. They then read their \"just right\" books and tally each time they see the word. This center gets them really noticing these sight words in text and is useful for students to do again and again. As a class, you can even graph or keep track of how many times each word was found over time.\n\n.<a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Sight-Word-Fun-K-1-Winter-Theme-1619022\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-74 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/page-039-224x300.png\" alt=\"K-1 Dolch Sight Word Cards &amp; Activities. http://blog.printableprompts.com/8-ideas-for-winter-sight-word-fun/\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n7.Type it!- Provide the stack of sight word cards, have students choose a card, and type the word on the card. This can be done with an old keyboard not attached to a computer, or if computers are available you can open a basic word processor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n8.Read it Make it!- This is one of my students' favorites! Read the word, then make the word either with pipe cleaners, wiki sticks, or playdough. Super fun, creative, and gets them noticing the letters in each of the sight words.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCheck out the sight word cards I created and get the game directions/ recording sheets for activities here!\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Sight-Word-Fun-K-1-Winter-Theme-1619022\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-78 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/page-0001-224x300.png\" alt=\"K-1 Dolch Sight Word Cards &amp; Activities. http://blog.printableprompts.com/8-ideas-for-winter-sight-word-fun/\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>",

Photos of our favorite books and characters fill one bulletin board, sorted, after careful deliberation, by character trait and theme. The students' \"square letter names\" line the walls with carefully calculated area and perimeter.\n\nAs I greet my students at the door, they meet me with smiles and stories of last night's dance class, baseball practice, or new news they hope to share at our morning meeting. Creativity, innovation, questions, and new convictions are tossed around the room throughout the day. As I turn out the lights at the end of the day I scan the room one more time.There is evidence that I have worked hard, my students have worked harder, and my classroom is a great place to be. I bet you'd never guess... my lessons are aligned with the...COMMON CORE!\n\nBut after my own children are tucked into bed for the night, I sit down and turn on my computer. My \"Facebook Newsfeed\" is filled with disgruntled comments and posts about the Common Core. As I open the webpage for the local news, I see an article about those rallying against the standards. I hear and read arguments that new standards leave no room for creativity, leave no room for innovation, are ruining our students. I can't help but be filled with an overwhelming sense of frustration.\n\nAre these people reading the same standards I am? What is this \"Common Core <em><strong>Curriculum</strong></em>\"?I try, in vain, to find it, but one does not exist. My best speculation is that teachers, administrators, and therefore parents are uncomfortable with change. They mistake a new district purchased \"program\" for the \"new standards\". They mistake the new testing for the \"new standards\" and they mistake the stresses of a new evaluation system with the \"new standards\".\n\nThis blog is my response. This blog is a place where I will share lessons, activities and ideas that will hopefully help us, as educators, to become inspired to refine our skills as teachers and embrace the change and the opportunity for new possibilities and adventures...

    "title": "First Grade and the Daily 5- Launching Read to Self",
    "content": "So I have been mentioning that I love using small group, guided approach to teaching. You are probably wondering how in the world I keep my other students learning in a meaningful way while I am working with these groups.\n\nThis is my first year\u00a0teaching first grade. Certainly with changes in the standards, all grade levels are adjusting their teaching content slightly in order to meet the standards.\n\nTo begin, this year my team decided to read and implement components of The Daily 5. \u00a0I have to admit, when I first read the book The Daily 5 by Gail Boushey and Joan Moser I had my doubts, but\n\nI know how important of a year first grade is , especially in regard to reading development. So I am that kind of crazy teacher who sees a new idea and says \"Let's do it!\" \u00a0I was quickly excited about implementing some of the components of the Daily 5 in order to help my students become more engaged learners.\n\nInstead of \"stations\" or typical centers, I began the year by launching \"Read to Self\", \u00a0\"Word Work\", \"Work on Writing\", \"Listen to Reading\", and then \"Read to Someone\" ( I introduced them in that order\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>The Launch</strong></em></p>\nOn the very first day of school, yes the very FIRST day, I launched Read to Self in my classroom.\n\nI began by teaching that there are \u00a0three ways to read a book: Read the pictures, read the words, and retell the story. I realized very quickly that the students didn't understand the retelling part, so I covered that part of my chart up, and we just practiced the first two ways. I knew by looking at their DRA scores from the previous year, that most of my students would be picture reading this time. I modeled what each type of reading looks like, then called upon a few students to try it. I put one book about apples (our beginning of the year theme) and then one \"easy reader\" book in each of their book boxes.\n\nThen I set an initial stamina goal: 1 minute. That's all... 1 minute.\n\nI assigned students spots in the classroom that are appropriate, and then set the timer.\n\nThe students did a pretty good job during this first try. We came back together and reviewed. At this time I created my ichart- The three expectations during this time for them were \"Read the whole time, stay in your spot, use quiet voices\". \u00a0I chose these three guidelines because I noticed that they could really fit any of the components of the Daily 5, and would be easy to model for the students. Again we practiced what this would look like. I did some silly modeling inappropriate ways to do Read to Self. They especially enjoyed when I crawled on the floor with a book on my head.\n\nWe practiced one more time- for one minute again and then we came back to reflect again.\n\nDay 2, we read for 2 minutes.\n\nNow during this initial launch there was not time for me to see any groups, but my main goal was to be busy, and set the expectation that I was not there to monitor the students, they were expected to do what they were supposed to be doing. They were not allowed to \"show\" me anything or \"tell me\" anything during this time. (later on I introduced using sticky notes to save \"I want to show you\" or \"This is important\" spots).\n\nWe continued to increase stamina 1 minute per day until about \u00a06 minutes (interestingly enough- most of their ages. Isn't there research somewhere about that?). I set the timer on the Smartboard, and stopped it as soon as someone was not engaged. We never pointed fingers, or talked about who was off task, we just stopped.\n\nWe were stuck at 6 minutes for about a week. We talked a lot about what I call \"building reading muscles\". I explained that this happens when you keep reading even when your brain tells you that you are tired of reading.\n\nSlowly but surely we made it over the 6 minute hump. As soon as they got to about 7 minutes I started calling some of my most needy readers over for a little boost in letter ID practice.\n\nI also began reading groups while they were working on some independent tasks (some of it was sort of like busy work, but it is necessary in the beginning to establish routines.) After students finished a guided reading book in group, they put it right into their book box. Slowly but surely the scales tipped from mostly picture reading, to mostly word reading.\n\nBy the end of November, they were reading 25 minutes independently. That means they are all reading in their spots, reading the whole time, and reading quietly. \u00a0Now I am able to rotate which reading group I take during this time.\n\nThe very best thing about Read to Self in a first grade classroom is that IT'S WORKING! The students are practicing reading so much that it is making the biggest difference. It's evidenced by one of my students saying \"Look at me closely Mrs.Ballestrini, can you see it?\"... \"Can you see how big my reading muscles are.\" And I <em><strong>can</strong></em> see it. :-)\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "Launching guided reading groups in my first grade classroom has been quite an adventure this year.\n\nI know, I know... guided reading is often said to be in stark contradiction to the Common Core, but the truth is that for early readers there is a definite need to have the students reading books with lots of words they can read, and some words they can't. It is in this small group, at the student level, where you can really provide them coaching and strategies to meet the challenges of the text.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Forming Guided Reading Groups</strong></p>\nI formed guided reading groups for my students based primarily on reading level (we use the DRA2 in my school). \u00a0I had several students (2 groups worth) who were reading at approximately the same level, so I split this group based on other needs. For example, three of the students at that level were having difficulty blending words, so I grouped them together. I ended up with 6 reading groups, with 1-4 students in each group.\n\nNow, onto the fun stuff! We began reading ... a lot!\n\nThe feeling I get from the research I have done, and my own experience, is that the more they read, the better they get! A wise teacher friend of mine once said \"If you want to teach them to swim, you don't stand by the edge of the pool and talk about it.. you get them in the water. They need to be reading to learn to read.\" That comment has really influenced my approach to teaching reading. My previous approach was to generally introduce 2 books a week. I would do a picture walk and first read on day one, second read and oral retell/comprehension day 2, and written comprehension day 3. I worried that this approach did not have my students reading enough, so I abandoned this approach for another: Read a lot of books! I now (in most cases) introduce a new book each day, and my students:\n<ul>\n\t<li>\u00a0love reading group</li>\n\t<li>are excited to see what new book they will be reading</li>\n\t<li>are becoming more accurate, fluent, and thoughtful readers</li>\n\t<li>are expecting to read lots of books, and are building reading stamina</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nIn order to manage progress monitoring and increasing the time spent reading, I created a student \"star\" chair (by taping a star picture to the back of a regular old chair). The students rotate through this chair, and each day, I listen to the student in the star chair read, and make notes about his/her progress.\n\nI choose to set my reading group instruction up in order to include most (if not all) of the components of balanced literacy each day: phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency &amp; comprehension.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Guided Reading Group Lesson Schedule</strong></p>\n3 minutes fluency- Students choose and read a familiar text, select a favorite or important part to read, or even reread a poem I have introduced to the class.\n\n3 minutes- Phonics/Phonemic awareness warm up. \u00a0Writing on white boards, building words with letter tiles etc. (I try to link this to the new text students will be reading).\n\n1 minute new book introduction- This is QUICK! I read the title, tell the students the character names, and for some of my struggling readers, do a quick \"word walk\" (\"Can you find the word \"said\" on this page) to get them ready to read. I then give the students a one line \"hook\" to get them interested (\"I wonder if they will ever find spot\").\n\n5 minutes reading- All students are whisper reading to themselves during this time. This is when I take a quick running record of the student in the star chair. \u00a0It is a little noisy, but it is more distracting to me than it is to my students. \u00a0While the students are reading, I place a reading comprehension discussion card in the center of the table. When the students are done reading the book, they look to the card, and find a page that helps them to answer the question. They practice rereading the page they chose until all readers are done reading.\n\n3 minutes comprehension discussion- Students read the page they chose and their ideas reasoning in regards to the question/ prompt.\n\nStudents then bring this book home to practice reading each day.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Using Questioning Strategies to Promote Independence and Discussion</strong></p>\nSince the students have practice the question prompts, I am beginning to support the star student to become a \"discussion director\" by helping them to choose the question card/ prompt for the group. This is really just the beginning of developing the student independence and discourse in reading group, but I am excited about their engagement and love of reading, as well as reading progress so far. \u00a0As for the written comprehension piece, I am really working to build oral comprehension and decoding strategies at this point in the year. When they are ready, I will introduce more of a formal written comprehension piece, but it will likely be completed independently.\n\nWhat are the other kids doing during all this time? Stay tuned, I'll post about that soon!\n\n<a title=\"Guided Reading Discussion Pack\" href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Guided-Reading-for-CCSS-Reading-Comprehension-Discussion-Cards-Response-1580805\"><img class=\" wp-image-20 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/guided-reading-300x166.png\" alt=\"Guided Reading Discussion &amp; Response http://blog.printableprompts.com/launching-my-first-grade-guided-reading-groups/\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /></a>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Check out my TeachersPayTeacher store\u00a0 <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printable-Prompts\">http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printable-Prompts</a>\u00a0if you're interested in downloading any of my guided reading materials.</p>",

The children are abuzz with excitement and anticipation of all of the holiday celebrations and festivities.\n\nOne problem I have been running into is a lack of interesting resources for my beginning readers (who still need patterned text, but have flown through the limited titles available to me).\nAs a result I created a few Christmas Mini books. My students have just loved them. They love that they can highlight the focus sight words, and many of them enjoy coloring the pictures when they share the books with family members at home. I also included a couple of follow up activities for each book.\n\nCheck them out here!\n\n<a title=\"Christmas mini books\" href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Printable-Christmas-Mini-Books-1573887\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Christmas-Mini-books-300x265.jpeg\" alt=\"Christmas Mini books http://blog.printableprompts.com/its-holiday-time/\" width=\"300\" height=\"265\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDuring writing time, I am using some fun and engaging journal writing prompts. The kids LOVE to alternate through narrative, expository , and opinion writing. \u00a0The thing I have enjoyed about these prompts is that there are two different versions, both with the same topics. The second version (included in the pack) gives a little more support to my struggling learners but they are still writing about what their peers are.\n\nCheck this pack out here!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/December-Journal-Writing-Prompts-1573504\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-25 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Christmas-Journal-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Christmas Journal http://blog.printableprompts.com/its-holiday-time/\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/December-Journal-Writing-Prompts-1573504\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-26 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Christmas1-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"December Journal Sample http://blog.printableprompts.com/its-holiday-time/\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/December-Journal-Writing-Prompts-1573504\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-27 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Christmas3-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"December Journal Sample http://blog.printableprompts.com/its-holiday-time/\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI also have my students working on independent writing projects.

    "content": "Happy More Math Monday!\nIn my classroom, I use a guided math approach during math time, so I use math games and centers daily. I have recently created some fun games and activities that my students have enjoyed again and again.\n\nOne of my (and their) favorite things to do is \"Write the Room\" type activities. I print out cards, hang them up around the room, and it's like a math scavenger hunt around the classroom. \u00a0I have used them with all 16 of my first graders working at once, and I have also used it as a center. Another neat thing about these cards is that I leave them up for a few days, so even when the children are not at the center, they are seeing and solving math facts throughout the day.\n\nAnother one of our favorite activities is \"Color by Math Fact\". These types of activities require students to practice some basic \"drill\" practice, but in a fun engaging way. Color by fact also gives students a strategy to start self monitoring their own work. If the color doesn't make sense, or the sum/difference is not listed, the students know to go back and check their work.\n\nHere's a my holiday activity pack, which includes write the room activities, color by number, partner games, and Christmas word problem solvers.\n\n<a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Math-Pack-CCSS-aligned-1561788\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-38 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Christmas-Math-Pack1-225x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Christmas Math Activities! http://blog.printableprompts.com/more-math-monday/\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Math-Pack-CCSS-aligned-1561788\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-37 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/christmasmath3-225x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Christmas Math Activities! http://blog.printableprompts.com/more-math-monday/\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Math-Pack-CCSS-aligned-1561788\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-39 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Christmasmath2-225x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Christmas Math Activities! http://blog.printableprompts.com/more-math-monday/\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn my classroom now, we are also working to develop fluency through learning about fact families. My students have enjoyed these cute gingerbread fact family packs so much! I laminated the pages and have students use white board markers. For some of my struggling students I put sticky notes with the \"fact family\" numbers in the roof and they moved the stickies around in order to create number sentences in the fact families.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Fact-Families-to-20-1562375\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-44 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Gingerbread-Fact-Families-225x300.png\" alt=\"Gingerbread Fact Families http://blog.printableprompts.com/more-math-monday/\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Fact-Families-to-20-1562375\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-45 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Gingerbread-Fact-Families1-225x300.png\" alt=\"Gingerbread Fact Families http://blog.printableprompts.com/more-math-monday/\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nI also want to add that last year I taught third grade, and a huge focus of my teaching was to teach repeated addition and multiplication.

Cooperative Peer Problem Solving! http://blog.printableprompts.com/peer-cooperative-problem-solving/\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>I have spent huge parts of my academic day\u00a0solving the case of the missing brown crayon, the girl who accidentally stepped on another students toe, or a child who cut in line. \u00a0I began to realize that these students were depending solely on me to solve any problem they came across, no matter how small. I decided that it was time to think outside the box, to empower my students to become problem solvers. I figured if I could teach them how to read, solve multistep math problems, work collaboratively in pairs... that I could certainly teach them to solve problems with their peers. This sort of independence helps me to get through the day, but also empowers students to develop social skills and relationships they can manage. For the most part, they shouldn't need an adult to solve the kinds of problems that first graders are having.\n\nMy solution... I developed a peer problem solving \"system\" in my classroom called \"Super Problem Solvers\". I used a similar instructional approach to the one that I would with any lesson I teach, modeling with explicit instruction, guided practice, independent practice. \u00a0I made sure to explain the difference between situations that are appropriate for teacher help, as well as \"first grade problems\". \u00a0We also role played problem solving, and brainstorm appropriate responses.\n\nI then set up a \u00a0\"Super Problem Solving Area\" in my classroom. \u00a0I use a big poster sized cutout of a gumball machine and the cheap circle labeling stickers in my room. Above the gumball poster are \"Say\" and \"Do\" directions to support my students in problem solving. \u00a0The students go to this area to solve their problem with a peer. When they have solved the problem, they stick a \"gumball\" sticker on the chart.\n\nWere there many more \"first grade problems\" the first couple of days? Yes!\n\nDid some students, who had rarely had any issues in the past, suddenly have several \"problems\" in one day? Yes!\n\nTo me this was all evidence that the students were getting used to the problem solving process we were using in our classroom.\n\nFor the first few days my students would often still come to me. Before they began \"tattling\" I asked \"Is this a first grade problem?\" The students usually answered \"Yes\" and met a friend in the problem solving area.\n\nWe have been using this system for about two months now, and I have noticed that there are less and less \"problems\" to begin with. My students have gotten so good at problem solving, that sometimes they solve problems seamlessly.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_55\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Peer-Problem-Solving-1600441\"><img class=\"wp-image-55 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/problemsolving-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Super Problem Solvers!

We have been reading many of the wonderful stories by Joy Cowley about Mrs.Wishy Washy and the Meanies.\n\nThe most exciting thing for my students has been that they are able to read enough now to navigate the text on their own, or read along with me during the read aloud.\n\nFrom the moment they saw the cover of Mrs.Wishy Washy, the students seemed to make a connection- there was really instant excitement.\n\nI started by reading Mrs.Wishy Washy and asking students to create a basic \"beginning, middle, end\" retelling book. (<a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/MrsWishy-Washy-Activities-1574753\">Freebie Here)</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/MrsWishy-Washy-Activities-1574753\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-116 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cover-wishy-washy-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Mrs.Wishy Washy Activities! http://blog.printableprompts.com/mrs-wishy-washy-and-the-meanies/\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen we went on to read about the Meanies. The students created their own meanies and did some descriptive writing about them.\nNext on the agenda was \"Shopping with the Meanies\" and \"The Meanies Came to School\". At this time, the kids were in LOVE with these little critters. They were excited to write their own stories about the trouble the meanies could cause in all different places! One student chose to write about the meanies going to the north pole. another wrote about the meanies at a local ice cream shop. The students were so excited, and not one of them looked up and told me that they didn't know what to write.\n\nSplishy Sploshy for my students was the ultimate merge of these two beloved stories. They were so excited to see how Mrs.Wishy Washy would handle those meanies, and were even more excited when they came to school the next day and saw their meanies hanging up to dry on the clothesline on our bulletin board.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/meanies.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-59 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/meanies-169x300.png\" alt=\"Mrs.Wishy Washy and the Meanies! http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/MrsWishy-Washy-Activities-1574753\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\nThis has been a wonderful opportunity to merge reading and writing , character traits, and fun!\n\nOne of my students summed it up as she walked out of the room today. \"Bye Mrs.B...

I love this time of year with my students.\n\nChristmas and Holiday time has passed and we are now on our school vacation. Time for me to relax, enjoy my own children, and plan lots of fun things to do for when we get back to school in January!\n\nI can't think of anything more fun in winter than all of the fun Snowmen books I love to share with my students. Carolyn Buehner has given us the gifts of <em>Snowmen at Night</em>,<em> Snowmen at Work, Snowmen All\u00a0Year</em>, and even<em> Snowmen at Christmas</em>. One thing my students have enjoyed in the past is writing a \"Snowman Job Application\" for a job related to what they read about in the book. It really is like their own snowman creation comes to life!\n\nHere are some of my favorite snowman &amp; winter stories!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/snowmanbooks.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-94 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/snowmanbooks-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Favorite Snowman Books! http://blog.printableprompts.com/baby-its-cold-outside/\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nTo celebrate one of my favorite times, I have created and posted my brand new Snowmen Math and Literacy Pack. I really enjoy using a small group approach almost throughout the entire school day, so you'll find small group, partner activities, and some word work games and mats.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Winter-Theme-Word-Family-Mats-Word-Work-Center-1616916\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-100 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ig-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Word family mats for word word center. http://blog.printableprompts.com/baby-its-cold-outside/\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nMy first graders are HUGE fans of the word work mats. Mostly, they love the fact that I let them choose what to use to create the \"onset\" or first letter on the word family mat. In the bin, I usually include the word family mats, small containers of playdough, wiki sticks, pipe cleaners, and even dry erase markers. This is one of the activities that students are often waiting for. It's great for decoding, encoding (writing/spelling), and even fine motor skills.\n\nHappy Winter!\n\nCheck out my Snowmen pack here!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a title=\"Snowman &amp; Winter Fun!\" href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Snowman-Winter-Fun-Math-and-Literacy-Bundle-1617006\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-97 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SnowmanCover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Snowman &amp; Winter Fun! http://blog.printableprompts.com/baby-its-cold-outside/\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.teachersnotebook.com/product/PrintablePrompts/snowman-amp-winter-fun-literacy-and-math-activities\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-131 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Snowball3inarow-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Snowball 3 in a row game!

    "title": "4 Word  Walls that Work!",
    "content": "So as I began my first year in first grade, I felt like every day I was walking into another teachers' classroom thinking: \"Oops, I forgot to do that!\" or \"I think I should hang that up too.\" One of those things was \u00a0a word wall, so I promptly headed to the store, bought a cute monkey set of cards to write the alphabet on... and VOILA I had a word wall. I added the students' names and the sight words we had reviewed and guess what? Even with reminders, no one looked at it. No one used it... ever. It was too static. \u00a0So here are a few suggestions for \"Word Wall\" ideas that I have found worked really well.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Interactive Word Wall</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">When I taught third grade this is the kind of word wall I used and my students loved it! By this time, most of them had a good handle on spelling those common \"sight\" or \"high frequency words\", so what I decided to do was to create a wall. To begin I just hung up the different subject areas. I wrote some of the upcoming vocabulary terms from each area on cut up sentence strips \u00a0The students then sorted which terms they thought belonged in each category.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The result: Students were on the lookout for these important vocabulary words. Their ears perked up when I said \"Commutative Property\" and they all looked to the board to see if they had put the word in the correct spot. Periodically I made a refresh batch of words to sort, and once the students knew all about a word, I stapled a manila folder to the bottom corner of the board which said \"Words We Own\" and I slid the pieces in there. \u00a0Students looked for the vocabulary words, they used them in discussion and in writing. \u00a0I wish I had a better picture, but I really made a very basic board. Here's what it looked like before the words were on it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4437.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-71\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_4437-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4437\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Now that I am blogging I sure wish I had taken some better pictures! :-)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Individualized Word Wall</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">If you are familiar with the \"Quick Word\" books, then you probably know that they aren't really a wall at all. But they do serve a similar purpose. Students in my third grade class loved their quick words. They would monitor their own spelling of those high frequency/ tricky words. I would add to them, they would often add the vocabulary from our word wall, and they would even add when they found an interesting word while reading. \u00a0These were certainly used!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0In first grade, I opted for a different approach. I took a manila folders and stuck each alphabet letter to the inside. \u00a0I have also made them by taping two folders together to become \"writing offices\" (I may actually invest in some more heavy duty dividers\u00a0because they do tip over). I then used one of the small sticky notes to add words that each student commonly misspells in his/her writing. Students can take these\u00a0out when they are\u00a0completing writing tasks or are wondering \"How do I spell...\" You can even use a similar approach to the interactive word wall. Once they have \"mastered\" spelling a word, \u00a0add the sticky note to a \"Words I Know\" envelope on the back of the folder.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wordwall.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-152\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wordwall-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"wordwall\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Language Experience Charts</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">This is especially useful in kindergarten and first grade, especially in the beginning of the year. (<a href=\"http://www.oasisnet.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=cAOIGO1ZV_w%3D&amp;tabid=1109\">Here is a link</a> to read a little more about this approach)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Students generate responses to reading, or a story based on an experience, such as our trip to the apple orchard. Certain words, or parts of words are highlighted for students, and the story is hung up around the room. Students read the stories again and again, which builds fluency, but they also become so familiar with these stories, poems, or responses, so they know just where they can find the word \"can\" or \"will\" or \"use\" in the classroom because they know it has been in one of our writing activities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Student Created Word Wall</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">I saved the best for last! This year, a colleague and I were discussing the ineffectiveness of our traditional word wall, and she came back with an idea for a student created one focusing on relevant vocabulary.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">At first, we sifted through books(non fiction) on our current topic of study and reading (fire safety for example) and provided students each with a card that had an important content related word. The students then listened to the story, raised their card when they heard their word, and then had the task of creating a visual to match the word. We then sorted the words. At first I created the categories \"Can, Have, Are\" and we sorted the words into those three categories on our word wall.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">When students went to write their informational piece about the topic, they would take their webs right over to the wall, and the visuals helped them to remember the meaning.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">After some practice, students quickly started asking to add new words that they had found onto the word wall, which means that young first graders are able to identify and \"define\" important words in an informational text!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">This has been my favorite approach to a word wall in first grade. Students are engaged in the reading task,\u00a0This approach also taught them a great deal about diagrams and text features. They look to find the word in the text, often using labels or captions, and then have to share the idea in their own illustration, often using an arrow to indicate\u00a0exactly what their word means. \u00a0Better readers, better writers, better thinkers!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_5965.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-153\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_5965-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5965\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>",

    "content": "Travel back in time with me about 6 weeks.\n\nI decided late November to begin posting some of my \"byproducts\" as my husband calls them, to teacherspayteachers.\n\nI have to admit, I have become a little bit addicted to creating products... and I feel like it's making me a better teacher. Here's what I have noticed in this short time period.\n\n1. I think out my lessons in more detail. As I create materials for myself, I usually create the lesson, anticipate student difficulty and make a plan. When I create my products knowing that I plan to post them, I put even more thought into the best way to differentiate the product. I create what is needed for the differentiated lesson. Overall, I am more prepared!\n\n2. I am reflective. When I teach my lessons I have always reflected upon the lesson... like \"Wow that went well!\" or the too often, \"Well it seemed like a good idea!\" Now that I am posting my products, I go home and immediately revise the materials I create after I use them in my classroom. I update my \"teaching suggestions\" and have a better, more solid lesson for myself to use in years to come. This kind of motivation to create the changes NOW, not just some scribbled sticky note in my plan book that I won't be able to decipher in 365 days. I also sometimes have those (what I call) \"mid teaching lesson makeover moment\" where I originally thought my lesson idea would be good, but then a better idea comes to me as I am sitting there before my students, so of course I go with it. Then I go home, \u00a0and usually add an alternative lesson/ idea to my product before I post it.\n\n3. I am networking and learning from a wonderful community of inspirational, motivated, ambitious, and enthusiastic teachers. I have exchanged e-mails, shared pinterest boards, shared \"feedback\" and received feedback from other teachers who love what they do. I really believe that is one of the best ways to keep that \"fire\" for teaching alive, surround yourself with people who have the same passion you do.\n\nSo, less than 2 months later, I am continuing to post on my <a href=\"http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts\">TeachersPayTeachers shop</a>, I started a <a href=\"http://www.teachersnotebook.com/shop/PrintablePrompts\">TeachersNotebook</a> shop (they have PINNING PARTIES! there!), and I love my job more than ever.\n\nAs I start this New Year I know I am blessed to have a wonderful family, two beautiful boys (3 and 7), and the best job in the world!\n\nIn the words of one of my favorite people, Walt Disney, \"All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.\"\n\nHappy New Year!",

    "content": "I originally wanted to keep this a place where I shared about all my teaching experiences and journeys. But at a time like this, I feel like this is also a good place to relate- teacher to teacher, person to person- about things that happen.\n\nThis week, my younger cousin went missing. After a three day search, he was found, but was taken from us too soon. My heart is broken.\n\nI tried to keep a smile on my face, but those 16 beautiful first graders could sense that something was \"up\". I didn't share with them what happened, it wasn't appropriate, but they met me each day this week with hugs, smiles, and kind notes, like \"Mrs.B, You are the best teacher in the world. I love you.\" So although this tragedy had nothing to do with my job, those students and the community we have built together, are a \u00a0huge part of my life. They were the sunshine on a rainy day, when I was just trying to go on, press on, through my heartache.\n\nOnce I overcame the initial shock, I turned to picture books to try to understand and comfort myself. I understand the power of children's books. Maybe that's why I became a teacher in the first place.\n\nOver the past week, as arrangements are made, and we wait to say our final goodbyes, I have been reading and seeking out children's books. \u00a0Sometimes the simplicity of the words- the optimistic spirit- is just so calming to the soul.\n\nI think this list is worth sharing... because sad things happen. \u00a0They happen to us and our families. They happen to friends, and they will sometimes happen to our students. It is our job to comfort our students and their families in times of grief and sorrow. So here it is- a list of a few books which I found to bring me a little comfort in this absolutely tragic time.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Booksaboutloss.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-143\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Booksaboutloss-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Booksaboutloss\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Love you always Jake!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1991-2015</p>",

Useful for my students\n\n2.Help me make connections between the different lessons I am teaching\n\n3. Useful for readers like YOU!\n\nMost recently, I have decided to go into the world of creating some materials inspired by common children's books and fairy tales. There are so many different versions of these tales that lend themselves to connections between texts, themes, and even characters. These kinds of tales are also often commonly known, so in many ways, a closer read for vocabulary or point of view is more accessible because the students generally have a basic idea of the plot. These stories also lend themselves to the \"written retell/summary\", which is something that my first graders are focusing on right now. If they know the story well, and have relevant materials to practice, I think that these tales are really useful to use in the development of a new/complex skill.\n\nIf you're looking for some fairy tale teaching resources to support comprehension,check these out!\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/3d151c8a-f503-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/jack-and-the-beanstalk-literacy-activities\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1977\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/thumbnail1-jack-and-the-beanstalk-literacy-activities.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"244\" height=\"244\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cd62e600-f503-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/little-red-riding-hood-literacy-activities\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1978\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/thumbnail1-little-red-riding-hood-literacy-activities.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"244\" height=\"244\" /></a>\n\n<a title=\"Three Little Pigs Literacy &amp; Math\" href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/My-Account/Favorite_Sellers\">\n</a><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/155dcef6-f74e-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/goldilocks-and-the-three-bears-activities\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1979\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/thumbnail1-goldilocks-and-the-three-bears-activities.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"244\" height=\"244\" /></a>",

They love reading about them, writing about them, drawing them... pretending to be them.\nSo a combination between this realization, a need for research materials in my classroom, and the super cute clipart of TongassTeacher.... has produced my new animal literacy packs!\n\nFirst it was <strong>Forest Animals</strong>....\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Forest-Woodland-Animals-1684933\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-159 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/forest-animal.preview-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Forest &amp; Woodland Animal Pack! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Forest-Woodland-Animals-1684933\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-160 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/forest-animals-scramble-squirrel-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Forest &amp; Woodland Animal Pack! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nThe children love completing the graphic organizers after reading some \"just right\" informational books. I got\u00a0LOADS of nonfiction book packs which are just at their level with my Scholastic points for FREE!!! They also love completing the themed follow up sentence scramble and word scramble activities.\n\nThen came <strong>Farm Friends</strong>\u00a0...\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Farm-Animals-1693831\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-161 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/farm-animals-cover-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Farm animals pack! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Farm-Animals-1693831\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-162 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/farm-friends-preview-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Farm animals pack! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Farm-Animals-1693831\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-163 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/farm-animals-cows-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Farm animals pack! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd most recently.... (drum roll please) <strong>Jungle Animals</strong>!\n\nThese resources are great for researching what we think of as jungle animals (although many of them are really safari/ savanna animals). As I was creating them, I kept thinking about my experiences at the zoo, so I've also included some \"zoo\" titled pages as well!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Jungle-Zoo-Animals-Literacy-Activities-1699032\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-164 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/jungle-animals-cover-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Jungle animals pack! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Jungle-Zoo-Animals-Literacy-Activities-1699032\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-165 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/jungle-animals-preview-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Jungle animals pack! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Jungle-Zoo-Animals-Literacy-Activities-1699032\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-166 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/jungle-animals-letter-scramble-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Jungle animals pack! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe kids absolutely ADORE these cut &amp; glue letter scrambles.\n\nSee... informational text IS fun, engaging, and appropriate for early elementary.\n\nThe more I make, the longer my To Do list becomes!

    "title": "Paired Texts- Teaching with fiction & informational texts",
    "content": "As promised, I'm back discussing paired texts.\n\nI hadn't really thought a lot about pairing informational and fictional texts as an objective before the implementation of the Common Core. I'll tell you what though, my students LOVE this concept and it adds a great amount of FUN and continuity to my instruction.\n\nOne thing my first graders \u00a0love about this concept is that we might spend the whole week, for example, learning, reading, and writing about bears. They are able to make lots of connections between the texts, and reread familiar texts. It also gives young children the opportunity to learn and ask questions in context. Sometimes that \"wondering\" doesn't happen on demand with a first read of a story or introduction to a topic.\n\nPairing texts has also given me a wonderful opportunity to accomplish tackling all three modes of writing expected (narrative, opinion, and explanatory) in a really natural and thoughtful way. \u00a0For example, once students have learned about spiders, they can write facts about spiders, list the steps to make a spider out of paper/ other craft materials, tell whether they think spiders are \"cute\" or \"creepy\", and write a story about a spider.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI feel like my students are learning how to be learners. They are engaging with books in a context that makes sense. They are making connections between texts and then across time. They are engaged and they are having FUN!\n\nI generally like to use at least 1 fictional story, one informational book, one video(if available), and one poem. I have begun setting out to capture some of those paired text activities in some of my new resources. Although I wish I could include the poems and videos in these packs, those materials belong to someone else, and can't be included. I usually find, however, that a simple pinterest\u00a0or youtube search will bring me what I need in those areas.\n\nSo here they are: Paired text mini unit resources :-)\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Raccoons-Fiction-Informational-Paired-Text-1685420\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-171 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/paired-text-raccoons-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Raccoon paired text mini unit to use with The Kissing Hand and any informational text about raccoons. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Click-Clack-Moo-Cows-Paired-Text-Mini-Unit-for-Fiction-Informational-1707765\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-172 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/paired-text-cow-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Paired Text Mini Unit to use with Click Clack Moo and any cow informational text. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Pigs-Paired-Text-Fiction-Informational-1707705\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-173 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/paired-text-pig-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Paired Texts mini unit to use with If You Give A Pig a Pancake and any informational text about pigs. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Moose-Fiction-and-Nonfiction-Paired-Text-Mini-Unit-1686083\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-174 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/paired-text-moose-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Paired text mini unit to use with If You Give a Moose a Muffin and any informational text about moose. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Jenn\n\n&nbsp;",

It's been super fun, and I am so excited to have this \"hobby\" (oh who am I kidding... it's a part time job).\n\nIt's been an interesting situation because I feel like I am spending my time balancing my family and children, planning for my class, blogging, working on teacherspayteachers resources, AND figuring out how to get them to sell? I have some products that I am super proud of, and I just want to share them with the world!... but how can I get people to find them? \u00a0TeachersPayTeachers is flooded with excellent resources and sometimes it can even be difficult to find exactly what you're looking for.\n\nSo here's my most recent way of sharing by linking from one product to other related products... which will hopefully help people find my resources.\n\n<em><strong>Adding links to my other resources in product descriptions.</strong></em>\n\n<strong>The easy way for just a link or 2:</strong>\n\n1.Go to the TPT product you'd like to add a link to (edit product and go to the description)\n\n2.Copy and paste this code into the description (usually after your product description).\n\n&lt;a href= \"http://www.example.com/\"&gt;nameofproductgoeshere&lt;/a&gt;\n\n<span style=\"word-spacing: normal;\">3.Open your Tpt store again in another tab and go to product listings. Select the product you'd like to link to.</span>\n\nCopy the URL (the http:// web address in the top browser bar)\n\n4. Click back to your first tab- with the product description open.\n\nPaste your link into the http://www.example.com/ part of the code (If you highlight the words http://www.example.com/ and then select Paste\u00a0your words will automatically replace my sample words... which is what you want to do).\n\n4.In the \"nameofproductgoeshere\"spot, simply delete sampletext and type your product name. These will be the words your viewers can see and click on.\n\nThis is what the link to my <em>Dinosaurs Before Dark</em> packet looks like with all the information entered:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts\"><img class=\"  wp-image-180 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dinosaur-sample-link-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"dinosaur-sample-link\" width=\"443\" height=\"332\" /></a>5.Repeat steps for each link you'd like to add.\n\n6.Save your product listing and VOILA!\n\nThis process is fine for including just a couple of links, but you do have to click back and forth a few times....\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><strong>The easy way to add lots of links, or if you have lots of products:</strong></em>\n\n1.Open a blank presentation/ word document. You will keep all your links here. I like to use a presentation (like powerpoint). I labeled slides with the categories of my projects before I even got started (\"February Resources\", \"Christmas Resources\" \u00a0etc).\n\n2.Copy and paste this code into your blank document. I copied and pasted it many times because I have many products I want to generate and organize links for.\n\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.example.com/\"&gt;nameofproductgoeshere&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere are what some of my slides looked like.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-177\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fiary-tale-links-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"fiary-tale-links\" width=\"292\" height=\"219\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-178\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/christmas-links-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"christmas-links\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-179\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/animal-links-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"animal-links\" width=\"319\" height=\"239\" /></a>\n\n3.Open your Tpt store and go to product listings. Select the product you want to create a link for.\n\n4.Paste your link into the \"http://www.example.com/\" part of the code (If you highlight the words http://www.example.com/ and then select Paste\u00a0your words will automatically replace my sample words... which is what you want to do).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n5. In the \"nameofproductgoeshere\"spot, simply delete sampletext and type your product name. These will be the words your viewers can see and click on.\n\nOnce I had all of my links in the proper format and sorted, I was ready to update my product listings.\n\n6.Click on product listings and click \"edit\" for the product description you want to add links to.\n\n7.Copy and paste the similar links (this is easy since I sorted mine by topic/like resources) in the product description. Usually these come AFTER your description of the packet.\n\n8.Save!\n\nI also went through to be sure that I wasn't linking to the product that they were already viewing... So I just deleted that link after I pasted it into the description.\n\nOh and one more thing... You know\u00a0all those \"meaningless\" and \"strange\" \u00a0symbols and letters in the code... well those are actually important. So if it doesn't work, go back and check that you didn't delete any of these things when you entered your information.\n\nI hope this helped you to organize and share all of your great resources!\n\nI also recently learned how to make my own banner image for <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/printableprompts?ref=hl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts\">TPT</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.teachersnotebook.com/shop/PrintablePrompts\">TN</a>... but that's for another post :-)\n\n-Jenn\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

I feel like each year after the 100th day, the year flies by!\n\nWe had a LOT of fun in first grade this year with the 100th day.\n\nWe completed tons of fun activities all day long!\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the day was our 100 second challenge activities!\u00a0I've included it as a limited time freebie in my TPT shop! I am working really hard to be able to upload some freebies here, but the cute images are making those file sizes too big. If you have any tips, I'd love to hear them!\n\nHere are our 100 second challenge activities. In these challenges, students have 100 seconds to work towards a goal.

When each student finished a book, they came up and filled out (or grabbed depending on how busy the chart was) a sticky note. They each read the books that we have practices in reading group, so it only took about 25 minutes to meet 99 books. I read 100 Snowmen (a math book) to them as our 100th book. They really loved this!\n\nIn the morning time, they completed some 100th day centers. My first grade team member created this awesome freebie to help walk you through those.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/original-2364539-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-743\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/original-2364539-1-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"original-2364539-1\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHappy 100th day!",

TeachersPayTeachers is throwing a sitewide sale on Wednesday, February 25! This means that all customers will receive 10% off of the total purchase at checkout. \u00a0As a new <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts\">shopkeeper</a>, this is a super exciting time for me! There are many things to get ready for... So here they are... 5 ways to get ready for your TPT sitewide sale!\n\n1. Get your resources posted and shared!-Get your resources posted on TPT before the sale. Sales generally bring in lots of traffic, so having as much of your inventory on as possible posted will be beneficial for you. Also, take the time to post them/pin them so people know about the great resources you have to offer!\n\n2.Set your sale- I always like to set the 20% off recommended sale. I appreciate buying from sellers who offer their products at a discount, so I set it this way as well. This saves my customers 28% off of the price of the product! and the final 10% off... TPT covers. It's at no additional cost to you!\n\n3. Share your sale!- If you don't have a sale/blog... get one! Get the word of the sitewide 10% off and also promote your own sale (28% off!!)!\n\n4. Get your products linked! Linking your products to other similar products will help others find related resources they may also enjoy. If you're not sure how to add clickable links to your products, check out my last blog article... <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/adding-links-to-tpt-resources-product-descriptions/\">a tutorial for adding links to TPT resources</a>.\n\n5.\u00a0Coffee- Stock up.. and brew it!\u00a0Too bad Dunkin doesn't deliver.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThese are just 5 ways I get ready as a seller... but I'm also a buyer, especially of awesome clipart. Stay tuned for tomorrow's 5 steps to get ready for a sitewide sale as a customer!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-Jenn :-)\n\n&nbsp;",

It's a TPT sitewide sale!\n\nIf you're anything like me, you LOVE to purchase products from amazing teachers across the country and world. It's amazing the work that goes into the fantanstic\u00a0resources posted by shopkeepers on TeachersPayTeachers.\n\nBut if you're like me, you're also trying to keep up with this buying while earning a teacher's salary. So... of course everyone loves a SALE!\n\nThis Wednesday, February 25, TeachersPayTeachers is offering one of their SITEWIDE sales! This is an amazing opportunity to save 10% off your entire purchase February 25 only! (Code: Heroes) When you combine this with the shop sales of 20% off offered by many of your favorite sellers, that's 28% overall savings! I know... its' pretty incredible. So while shopkeepers are getting ready for a sitewide sale, you too can get ready to get the resources you need at a big discount! BUT... The sale only lasts for a day, so you'll want to be ready to take advantage of these great savings!\n\nCustomers: 5 Ways to Get Ready For a TPT Sitewide Sale\n\n1.Check your plan book and calendar. Do you need resources for that upcoming math unit? Are your literacy centers getting a little stale? Do you have those spring printables, sure to engage your learners? Take a quick inventory of products that will help you and are needed in your classroom.\n\n2.Check your wishlist- My wishlist is FULL of things I love. \u00a0I recently moved to first grade from third though, so it's time to clean up that wishlist and remove those products that i'm not really wishing for anymore.\n\n3. Visit your Favorite Sellers pages- You might find details about the additional sale they're offering, or a new product that you missed and could use! Now would be a perfect time to get your hands on these resources at a great price.\n\n4.Search and fill that wishlist back up. Use your \"quick inventory\" to add new items you could use to your wishlist. I actually like to add some things that are \"definite yes!\" for me to my cart.\n\n5.This item is the same as on my seller's list- COFFEE! \u00a0I find myself up early (before my two young boys) searching and adding things to my wishlist or cart. Waking a little earlier with a good cup of coffee during a TPT sitewide sale is a must.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEnjoy and HAPPY SAVINGS!\n\n-Jenn\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/\">Check out my shop!</a>",

I have included pieces that are in color for the resource as well as black and white. I usually use the black and white version with my students, and create a version with the color pieces (as shown here) to add to our retell center. We discuss setting and characters (the setting belongs on the mat and the characters belong on sticks!). Then students practice retelling the story to a couple of partners. \u00a0When we are finished, I put the model along with the book in the retelling center for students to use during literacy center time as the year goes on.\n<h1>2.Written Response</h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/3d151c8a-f503-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/jack-and-the-beanstalk-literacy-activities\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1256\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Written-Retell2F-Summary.png\" alt=\"Jack and the Beanstalk Lesson Activities- These Literacy and Math activities will keep students excited as they learn to retell/ summarize, identify character traits, compare stories, and even write their own Narrative!\" width=\"337\" height=\"337\" /></a>\n\nOnce we have practiced orally retelling the story, students can keep their mats handy to write a summary/ retell of the story in a small retelling book. This version has guiding pictures , but I offer a blank page version in the resource as well. I have also included these vocabulary and character cards (this is just a sample) to support student writing. I usually display them on the board for students to use as a resource as they are writing. \u00a0 The resource also includes full page written retell or summary responses so you can choose the version that's best for your students.\n<h1>3.Other Supporting/ extension activities</h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/3d151c8a-f503-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/jack-and-the-beanstalk-literacy-activities\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1255\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/All-About-the-Characters.png\" alt=\"Jack and the Beanstalk Lesson Activities- These Literacy and Math activities will keep students excited as they learn to retell/ summarize, identify character traits, compare stories, and even write their own Narrative!\" width=\"391\" height=\"391\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDepending on my group of students, I usually choose 1-2 additional follow up activities.\n\nSome of the ones included are\n\n*Character web and writing pages\n\n*compare characters using a Venn\n\n* Compare different versions of the story\n\n*Write a Magic Bean Story\n<h1>4. Connect a math game!</h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/3d151c8a-f503-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/jack-and-the-beanstalk-literacy-activities\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1257\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Roll-Color-Math-Game.png\" alt=\"Jack and the Beanstalk Lesson Activities- These Literacy and Math activities will keep students excited as they learn to retell/ summarize, identify character traits, compare stories, and even write their own Narrative!\" width=\"393\" height=\"393\" /></a>\n\nNothing excites my students more than when one of their afternoon math centers connects to a story we've read! This one is definitely a favorite. You can play it as a roll and color game, or you can play it as a bump game!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLooking for Little Red Riding Hood story activities?\nThis resource is also jam packed with some fun follow ups as well!\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cd62e600-f503-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/little-red-riding-hood-literacy-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-227 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/little-red-riding-hood-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Little Red Riding Hood Literacy and Math activities- Book companion. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cd62e600-f503-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/little-red-riding-hood-literacy-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-229 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/little-red-riding-hood-scramble-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Little Red Riding Hood literacy and math activities! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cd62e600-f503-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/little-red-riding-hood-literacy-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-230 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/little-red-riding-hood-abc-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Little Red Riding Hood literacy and math activities! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nOne of the reasons I am so excited about them is the extension activities. Sometimes, practicing those common skills, such as ABC order, Narrative writing, or a addition is so much more exciting and engaging when it relates to the literacy topic. I have also included different version of retelling/ summarizing and comparing versions of the story (another first grade favorite thing to do!).\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Fairy-Tales-292847\">If you love teaching fairy tales click here to see all the fairy tale companions I've created!</a></span></h1>",

    "content": "To test, or not to test. That is the question that has been at the center of controversial and heated debates regarding testing and the Common Core. Usually the debate is regarding the overassessment of students, but recently in Connecticut, many elementary teachers have been mandated to take a reading \"survey\". I am not sure how the working definition of \"survey\" is different from \"test\" except that, for now, we are told our scores are not reported to anyone but us.\n\nMany teachers I know are uncomfortable. This side of the testing is a place that many teachers haven't been for a long time. The language and vocabulary in the questions alone (as can be seen on the practice test for the Foundations of Reading test) are difficult for some teachers to remember offhand. Many teachers were stressed and discouraged.. after all.. what is the difference between phonological awareness, phonemic awareness, and phonics? Does a teacher's confusion between the three on a \"survey\" mean that he or she doesn't know how to teach any one of those components? I'm not sure it does. Luckily for me, I recently finished my Master's Degree in Reading (I guess all that vocabulary/terminology cramming is paying off!)\n\nSo... here is a little \"cheat sheet\".... as a teacher I guess I should say \"study sheet\" of vocabulary and reading terminology related to early literacy. I tried to explain the words as understandably as possible. \u00a0If you're in need of a refresher for an assessment \u00a0or even just a sheet to place in the front of a binder for easy reference, click through to download the nice PDF version of my freebie.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Reading-Vocabulary-Terminology-for-Teachers-1755686\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-234 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/common-reading-words1-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Reading Terminology for teachers! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Reading-Vocabulary-Terminology-for-Teachers-1755686\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-235 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/common-reading-words-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Reading Terminology for teachers! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nDon't forget to leave feedback, and tell a friend to hop on and download from my TPT store as well!\n\n&nbsp;",

    "title": "TPT- The Return of \"Chaching\"",
    "content": "Hello there. It's spring here in CT, but still feels like winter (as is pretty much typical for New England). The result of all of this? I've been stuck inside and tried to make myself very productive. I'll list a few of my new things at the end of the post.\n\nBut first... for the explanation for my cheesy title.\n\nFor those of you who aren't TPT sellers, the \"Chaching\" sound is a notification sent to you whenever you sell a product on TeachersPayTeachers. It is an exciting moment, no matter how large or small the sale might be.\n\nIf you are a TPT seller, you probably mourned the loss of the \"chaching\" notifications a few months ago, making for an extra bleak winter. The notifications left without explanation and any indication of if they would return in the future. There was an emptiness in my day where my seven and three year old's \"chaching\" song and dance had once been.\n\nIf you're anything like me, you probably tried to get just as excited when you heard an e-mail notification only to have your hopes dashed when it was just an e-mail from Toys R Us, Old Navy, or Groupon.\n\nThis past week, however, just as spring was approaching, I awoke to a wonderful surprise. \"CHACHING!\" Could it be?... Could it be the return of the \"Chaching\"? Emerging from hibernation just in time for spring? IT was!\n\nOk... so I'm being a little dramatic, but the \"chaching\" sound matters! Why? I'm not really sure, except that it makes my heart beat fast and I sometimes have to hold back for jumping for joy each time I hear it- no matter how big or small the sale!\n\nIn my pondering, I've considered four\u00a0possible reasons the sound is such a big deal to me (and some of my seller friends).\n\n1.It's VALIDATING\u00a0to know that the products I have developed are valued and useful to other teachers. It validates that I, in fact, do have the ability to create worthwhile things.\n\n2.It's a SURPRISE! I don't have to check my e-mail, or login, or even open my app. I can be snuggled up for a movie with my kids, in my classroom late one afternoon, or even sick in bed (winter germs stink!), and suddenly... \"chaching!\"\n\n3.It's SUCCESS! I don't know about you, but I spend lots of money on my classroom. As a contracted teacher, salaries are set, and there aren't many opportunities (aside from summer school) to make additional money. TeachersPayTeachers has changed that for me and tons of other teachers around the country. The sound represents opportunity and success! It is a reminder that I can set and meet my goals!\n\n4. I, personally, find my kids to be pretty cute... and the song and dance they developed when the \"chaching\" rings through the house is priceless. I'm glad it's back! It's exciting to know that they SHARE in my joy and success.\n\nSo if you're reading this, and you work for TPT... Please don't ever take our chaching away again! It matters!\n\nAs promised, here are some of my newest goodies! I'll write about some more of them soon, but just want to give you a quick peak at some of my newest things!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Sun-1765424\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-239 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-sun-cover-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"The SUN!- Research companion to use with any classroom resources about the sun! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Sun-1765424\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-240 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-sun-observations1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"The SUN!- Research companion to use with any classroom resources about the sun! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Sun-1765424\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-241 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-sun-preview-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"The SUN!- Research companion to use with any classroom resources about the sun! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Stone-Fox-1775472\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-242 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/stone-fox-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Stone Fox book companion! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Be-A-Perfect-Person-in-Just-Three-Days-1776645\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-243 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/be-a-perfect-person-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Be A Perfect Person in Just Three Days - book companion! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;",

I've created a pack of 6 new spring centers. A couple of them are \"work work\" type centers, and a couple of them are writing centers.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Spring-Centers-1765309\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-244 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/spring-centers-preview-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Spring Centers for K-1!

My students are always a little more difficult to engage on a rainy day and indoor recess certainly doesn't help the matter. I've also put together some rainy day activities including response to a couple of my favorites <em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</em> and <em>The Rain Came Down.</em>\n\nI, personally, like to keep these as \"back pocket\" activities to use on that especially rainy week. It seems like their narrative and opinion writing also comes more easily when they can relate to the experiences.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Rainy-Day-Fun-1768456\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-254 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rainy-day-preview-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Rainy Day Fun!

    "title": "Teaching with the Common Core- 1 year later",
    "content": "It was exactly one year ago today that I decided to start blogging. I was frustrated about the pushback to the Common Core, a set of standards that I was embracing and LOVING in my classroom. I am just as frustrated today. I read popular children's book authors posting ridiculous things about the standards... I've heard community members say that we should \"overthrow\" the Common Core because it makes kids like zombies and all the \u00a0same (I'm not sure exactly how). \u00a0I have heard teachers saying it is stressing their students out. I have heard parents say that the Common Core dumbs things down for students. And still... I wonder, have they read the actual standards?\n\nAfter talking to a number of people and reading articles (and their comments) I think these are 2 big things at the center of the Common Core debate.\n\n1.Prescribed, scripted district programs and curriculum-\n\nIt seems that some school districts have ordered prescribed teaching programs that teachers are required to teach from, sometimes exclusively. Could it be a knee jerk reaction by a district, making sure that the teachers are meeting the standards? I believe that teachers are smart, teachers are professionals, teaching is a craft- and whenever teachers are handed their plans it's like they become a substitute in their own classrooms in a way. There is little choice\u00a0and few opportunities to develop new curriculum or bring in new resources that meet the standards. That is a surefire way to take the excitement and engagement out of teaching and learning.\n\nSome people are worried that they can't help their students (especially with math), because it's too complicated. I think this might be, in large part, due to the program the district chooses in some places. Some of the insane problems I have seen posted online and shared on facebook and the like, are absolutely ridiculous. I guess you could say that kind of problem fits within the standards, but those types of \"27 step first grade math problems\" just don't have to be what people are making them.\n\n2. Testing-\n\nSome people are confusing standardized testing with the standards. Politically, I get that there is a big connection. I can see why parents and community members would be concerned. Academically, however, when those 15 first graders are sitting in front of me, my goal is to teach them how to learn. To coach them as they explore and discover. None of the teachers I know are cramming for a test any more than they were with the state test (Connecticut Mastery Test). Are there concerns about the testing? Sure. I am always concerned when there is a huge emphasis on one measure. It is important to remember, however, that the standards don't ask for a test. The standards are just that... standards. \u00a0I wonder if people realize that there were standards before these... and ours in Connecticut actually weren't much different than the Common Core in many ways. There were also big standardized tests before the SBAC and like assessments... I took them when I was in school.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo what have I learned?\n\nI AM SO LUCKY! \u00a0I am lucky to work in a district where we are referred to as \"practitioners of education\". \u00a0I work in a district where I am allowed to decide how I deliver the standards. Do we have curriculum guidelines? Of course! But I can meet the standards through a favorite picture book (in fact, they're PERFECT for teaching Common Core Standards) or through a poem. If my students are exceptionally interested in animals, I have the freedom to choose to use materials, text, and resources to meet the standards using this topic (I don't think I'll ever understand why some people are complaining about informational books.. the kids LOVE THEM!).\n\nSo... here's what I have decided to do. I will unpack the standards one by one. I'll do at least one a week, and i'll share how I am meeting these standards in my first grade classroom. Maybe it'll shed some light on what the Common Core can be.\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "Here is my first post of many where I unpack the Common Core standards to show how I am implementing the standards in my classroom. I am hopeful that these posts will be helpful, inspiring, and enlightening to those who read them... mostly I hope that you can see how FUN meeting the standards can be!\n\nI figure the best place to unpack the standards with real examples would be right from my Grade 1 classroom.\n\nSo we begin:\n\n<strong>Reading Literature: Key Ideas and Details:</strong>\n\nStandard 1 (RL.1..1) Ask and answer questions about key details in a text.\n\nStandard 2 (RL.1.2) Retell stories including key details, and demonstrate an understanding of their central message or lesson.\n\nStandard 3 (RL.1.3) Describe characters, settings, and major events in a story, using key details.\n\nAND for the fun part...\n\n<strong>How I meet these standards:</strong>\n\nI think that these three standards are totally achievable and appropriate for students. In fact, the other teachers I have talked to have long been meeting these standards.\n\nI have written about my method of<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/launching-my-first-grade-guided-reading-groups/\"> guided reading discussion before</a>, but it seems appropriate to revisit it at this time.\n\nI use a model in my classroom that really melds the Daily 5 and traditional Guided Reading Groups.\n\nIn my reading groups I do some form of word work practice, vocabulary focus, fluency, and comprehension daily (some days some components are covered more quickly and thoroughly than others).\n\nEarly on, I began setting a purpose for reading and giving students a task by using these discussion cards:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Guided-Reading-1580805\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-290 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/guidedcards-characters-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Unpacking the Common Core Standards- Key Ideas and Details for first grade. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Guided-Reading-1580805\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-292 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/guided-reading-response-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Unpacking the Common Core Standards- Key Ideas and Details for first grade. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI also have cards for: What is the most important part? Who is the most important character, retell the story, what did you learn?, What are you wondering? \u00a0among other prompts.\n\nStudents read the text, I place the card on the table, and when they are finished \"whisper reading\", their job is to find the answer to the question, and find a part in the book that helped them decide (or included the answer). They then practice reading that part over (reread for fluency) and then we share answers and \"evidence\" as a group (great for oral fluency practice as well).\n\nAs my students have become familiar with the prompts, there is now a discussion leader \"star reader\" who chooses the question/ prompt for the text.\n\nSimply by rotating through these questions, giving students an opportunity to ask and answer the prompts, and by finding evidence... my students are meeting ALL of the Key Ideas and Details standards for the common core. They LOVE the \"mission\" of finding evidence. They enjoy taking a turn to be the discussion leader, and they are becoming better and better readers as a result.\n\nIn the guided reading pack I have posted on <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Guided-Reading-1580805\">TeachersPayTeachers</a>, I have all 12 discussion cards, written response pages to match each prompt, a planning sheet, and a progress monitoring sheet to use with any book.\n\nHere is a FUN way my students worked on determining author's message/theme or central message during Read Across America Week!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_6411.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-291\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_6411-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Unpacking the Common Core Standards- Key Ideas and Details for first grade. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"395\" height=\"296\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe read The Lorax, and then determined the author's message through the discussion of the Lorax and his actions and words. My students wrote the message in the speech bubbles and then created their own (super cute) versions of the Lorax.\n\nSome of their messages were \"Everyone needs to take care of the Earth. We need it to live\" \u00a0 or \"We need to take care of trees because many animals and people need them\".\n\nFor first graders, that's a pretty cool way to determine the author's message! They had so much fun with it and it was really deep thinking for them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI hope you enjoy and stay tuned!\n\n-Jenn\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

I'm running some additional sales, so check out my shops for big savings.\n\nI love my job as a teacher, and it's always great to have students, parents, and staff members remind me that I am doing a good job.\n\nI'll admit though, since my son has started school, this week has a whole new meaning for me.\n\nI think my son is SUPER lucky to have the teacher he does, and so, here are 5 reasons I appreciate teachers (as a mom)\n\n1. Teachers work LONG hours to make sure that they're ready for our children.\n\n2.Teachers often SPEND their own money on school materials and activities to use with... our children. I have seen a number of TeachersPayTeachers products come home with my son.\n\n3.Teachers DO special things to make our children SMILE! My son's teacher sent home this super cute \"Have a Great April Break\" card with a picture of the class. My son's face immediately lit up with a smile when he saw the card in his folder on the first day of break.\n\n4.Teachers APPRECIATE our children. We recently enjoyed a trip to Disney and my son picked out a special pen for his teacher. He said she was SO thankful that it was the ONLY pen she used all day.\n\n5.Teachers LOVE our children. My son's teacher loves to share about little things that he does, she believes in him and he often says \"I think I'm one of her favorites\". I know that all of her students probably feel this way, but it's an incredible thing to know that my son is and feels loved when I send him off to school 5 days a week.\n\nI know that all of these things seem so obvious... as a teacher I work long hours, spend time and money on my students, do special things for my students, appreciate each and every one of them, and LOVE them all so much... for some reason, it just means so much more to me when someone else is doing these things for MY child every day. It's the best gift a mom can receive. So as a Teacher and as a Mom, I say- HAPPY TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK!\n\n&nbsp;",

    "title": "My Biggest Aspiring Teacher Mistake",
    "content": "It's spring... and springtime means spring cleaning! This year, my family decided to really get rid of things we haven't used in over a year. My 3 year old and 7 year old were right with us on this! So we assembled boxes and tables for a yard sale this past weekend. We had several little boxes with kids odds and ends (Buzz Light Year missing his wing, A Woody Hat with no Woody...) you know.. the things the kids were willing to part with. Then there were random household things, loads of baby things (even though my \"baby\" is three now, it was so sad to say goodbye to that infant stroller), and then... an entire table full of teacher junk.\n\nI realized as I set up the table that I had been hoarding teacher materials long before I was a teacher. I always knew I wanted to teach, and it seemed like high school and college were taking forever. So,what did I do? I made my biggest \"aspiring teacher\" mistake- I stocked up on junk I thought a teacher might be able to use for when I someday had a classroom. This was a bad idea for several reasons:\n\n1. You don't know what you need until you have your class sitting in front of you. I had no idea what grade I would teach, so I just bought anything I saw that was cheap/on sale that I thought I might need. In addition, if you are fortunate, your district may actually provide crayons- Wait, you mean that stack of 20 boxes of crayons I bought 5 years ago was unnecessary? Those posters and banners still in their packages that I was planning to someday hang on the walls? My walls are actually covered with my students' work, I don't need the posters anyway!\n\n2. Times change- many of the things I bought were outdated 8 years later. One prime example of this is all of the calendar pieces I purchased. I use my SmartBoard for calendar each day now.\n\n3. Things get ruined. Did I really expect those \"smelly stickers\" to keep their \"smell\"? They didn't even keep their \"stick\"!\n\n4. There is a reason those items were on clearance-None of the teachers wanted them. This is the same reason I caution against taking a huge stack (filling the entire back of my little civic) of boxes of books and old resources from veteran teachers. If you aren't sure that you'll use it, or don't know how you'd use it... pass. I have taken so many things that other teachers didn't want. Once in a while I picked up a good read.. but largely, those same stacks of books in those same boxes emerged from my attic untouched and are now sitting out in my yard with a \"Free\" sign. And.. here I am starting the cycle all over again.\n\nSo I guess my lesson was that I was so in love with the idea of teaching that I thought spending my hard earned minimum wage high school dollars on posters and old books was a good idea- and it wasn't.\n\nMy suggestions-\n\n*Save the money- Trust me, you'll have plenty of years ahead of you where you will spend PLENTY of your money on things you know your students need.\n\n* If you want a \"gift\" from a veteran teacher, spend a few hours in his/her classroom. You'll learn more there than from any book.\n\nMoral of the story- My attic is thankfully a little emptier, my back is a little sore from all that lifting, and I still love my job more than I ever imagined I would.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

Yesterday I brought my two boys to go see her at a campground where I celebrated Mothers' day by (literally) playing on the playground with my mom and kids.. SO MUCH FUN!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_55651.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-354 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_55651-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5565\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nBeing a mom to my two little boys has been, by far, the biggest blessing in my life. My children bring me laughter, smiles, love, hugs, and cheer with each passing day.\n\nI'll admit, they sometimes also bring me migraines, gray hair, and exhaustion.\n\nOn this day, I am super thankful for my children. They love me when I'm at my best, snuggling up with a movie, holding their hands as we march down Main Street at the Magic Kingdom, or tucking them in each night.\n\nBut they also love me when I'm at my worst. 6 am morning breath, snapping \"Get your shoes on for the 10th time\", barricading myself in the kitchen with coffee and Dr. Phil after a long day of work. They are my world, they are my motivation.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10557608_10203946198592904_9056920033491167281_o.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-349 alignleft\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/10557608_10203946198592904_9056920033491167281_o-223x300.jpg\" alt=\"10557608_10203946198592904_9056920033491167281_o\" width=\"223\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11096424_10205849995866646_7268197263931432970_o.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-350 alignleft\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11096424_10205849995866646_7268197263931432970_o-190x300.jpg\" alt=\"11096424_10205849995866646_7268197263931432970_o\" width=\"205\" height=\"324\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTheir pictures sit on my desk, motivate me through the day, and\u00a0make the bittersweet end of the school year extra sweet.\n\nHappy Mothers' Day!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

The kiddos are DEFINITELY in full spring fever swing, just in time for end of year assessments. I admit, I get kind of excited for assessments. I always feel so proud of their hard work and kind of sad to send them on when there's still so much we can do ( I know.. I know.. they will all have wonderful second grade teachers who will do the job).\n\nWith that, I have started working on some of my summer resources.

There are pages to record observations and report on the day.\n\nHow could I not pair this with Henry and Mudge and the Starry Night? I know some teachers probably use camping/ camp as a fun way to end the year, so I wanted to be sure to include some great resources for those teachers who won't be out marching through the woods with their students. So. there are also writing activities (How to make a s'more YUM!) and a couple of cute basic math games and activities. \u00a0And of course I paired the book in a bundle with my Henry and Mudge comprehension resources to make it more classroom friendly!\n\nCheck it out here!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Camping-with-Henry-and-Mudge-1829395\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-360 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/original-1829395-1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Camping and Henry and Mudge bundle. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nHappy Camping!\n\n-Jenn",

    "title": "Purchasing Clip Art",
    "content": "My name is Jenn... and I'm addicted to clip art.\n\nI was going to do another \"Favorite Things\" post , but I realized that it's not really favorite <em>things</em>, more like favorite clip art. \u00a0I am too embarrassed to share how many clip art sets I purchased during the sale, but let's just say It'll be a busy summer creating with them!\n\nJust 6 months ago I'll admit, I thought one of my teacher friends (who is also on TPT) was insane for purchasing clip art. After spending countless hours searching for just the right images, I made my first purchase... and I didn't regret it! Children (especially in early elementary) need visuals to support text. I'd actually argue that visuals are just as important to everyone- grown ups alike. So, now I'm writing from the other side of the coin and I'll answer the question- in my opinion.\n\nWhy buy when you can get it for free?\n\n1. \u00a0Copyright/ Permissions for commercial use- \u00a0Check out the copyright or terms of use for any clip art you use (free or purchased). You'd probably be as surprised as I was at how little you are allowed to use for \"commerical\" use, which is what TeachersPayTeachers is. I have found some of my favorite sellers (I'll highlight a few at the end of this article) who allow for TeachersPayTeachers and usually limited small commercial use .\n\n2. It saves time- If you have an idea for a resource, or already have one created, there's nothing worse than going on a scavenger hunt for the different images you need. Half of the time, you can't use what you find on TeachersPayTeachers anyways!\n\n3. It's pretty- It is a new \"thing\" of mine to have the clip art in my packs \"match\" at least within the pack. \u00a0It helps to make a more cohesive packet, especially when the pack is all about one certain topic or skill. This clip art is also created by talented artists who have taken the time to do this as a business, so they are bright, beautiful, relevant and worth it!\n\n4. Black line/ Color- You have probably tried to copy a file or activity that is in color into black and white. Half the time you can't tell what the image was of. Never mind if you end up making copies of copies over the year. Many clip art artists offer black line (black and white) and the color version. This is awesome for creating color vocab cards and center games and matching student activities pages which need to be copied for each student.\n\n5. It's an investment- When I started purchasing clip art that supported and enriched my resources, they started selling!\n\n6. It supports other teachers and artists- \u00a0I actually feel kind of happy that somewhere, on the other end of that \"purchase\" button, someone who worked hard and created an awesome product is hearing \"Chaching!\"\n\nI so appreciate the clip art artists that I use, so here are a few of my favorite artists and recent purchases!\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Educlips\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-363\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Edulips-Icon-299x300.png\" alt=\"Awesome clip art artist!

She has the cutest \"stitch\" style that accents so many of the sets I love. I really love her animal sets, and have used them in all of my animal packs so far.

I have featured her art on my current blog design. She offers the most bright and vibrant clip art I have ever come across. She is a true artist and it shines through in all of her work. \u00a0She offers loads of wonderful seasonal sets along with bright accents, \u00a0the most wonderful doodle borders, and even some snazzy fonts, which give my products a little more pizzazz.She also offers graphic clubs and \"surprises\". \u00a0She offers these as a huge discount, but you do not see the clip art sets included until the specified date. I was skeptical at first about purchasing something before I ever saw it, but once I began using her work and seeing samples of some of her graphics club sets, I was sold. I recently enjoyed her Teacher appreciation pack, which she updated with a new set every day during Teacher Appreciation week. It felt like I had a present to open each day! \u00a0She usually lists these at a n additional discount when they first come available, so I always grab those up right away ( follow her on facebook to get updates!). She also just started selling the most wonderful paper goods, such as notepads and postcards.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here's one of her sets I purchased during the sale.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Limited-Edition-Ultimate-KIDS-Collection-Creative-Clips-Digital-Clipart-1195285\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-368 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/original-1195285-1-231x300.jpg\" alt=\"Kids clip art set by Krista Wallden- See a review on blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"231\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The uses for this versatile set are endless!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">So, all in all, I am addicted to clip art.

    "content": "Happy Wednesday! The week is over half over by now. I've been home with my sick little one for the past two days. It's so difficult to balance being a mommy and a teacher. Knowing that my own children are the most important thing, but it doesn't take away the teacher-guilt from being away.\n\nAnyway, I am writing in the few minutes of nap time relief and I want to share some of the new phonics resources that I am super excited about.\n\nUsing one of my recent purchases from Educlips (featured as one of my favorite clip art artists) I created a series of diphthong practice activities.\n\nI have long believed in the power of students seeing, saying, and moving in order to learn almost anything more effectively. This year, I've been really using this approach in my classroom. I have been using the chants and connecting these skills to the reading they are doing during reading groups, but I realized that I was lacking just a little more reinforcement practice. From that, my diphthong resources were born!\n\nEach pack includes full page phonics posters with an anchor word (the chant and actions are included on the teaching notes pages). Each pack also includes word cards with matching pictures. Students can match the picture to the word (If you cut the picture part off), they can be used for word sorts, abc order, word wall cards... so many different things! I have also included practice pages (2 per diphthong) plus a couple of additional cute activities to use as a follow up in centers or during morning work time.\n\nI hope you enjoy them as much as I have!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Diphthongs-aw-au-1853739\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-376 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/aw-au-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"aw/aw dipthong chant, practice, sort, and play activities. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Dipthongs-ew-oo-1854298\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-378 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ew-oo-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"ew-oo dipthong chant, practice, sort, and play activities. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Diphthongs-oy-oi-1853826\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-379 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/oi-oy-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"oi/oy dipthong chant, practice, sort, and play activities. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ou-ow-cover.jpg\">\\</a><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Diphthongs-ou-ow-1854173\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-380 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ou-ow-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"ow/ou dipthong chant, practice, sort, and play activities. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have also decided to offer them bundled (all for packs for the price of 3!) I am so excited about this bundle, and know that as new skills are added it's so nice to be able to incorporate the old skills as well for reinforcement. The common format of these packs helps to support their usefulness together and individually.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Diphthongs-1854338\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-377 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/diphthong-bundle-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Diphthong chant, practice, sort, and play pack! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>",

I have decided to offer this as a GROWING BUNDLE.\n\nThis means:\n\nYou pay the (discounted) bundle price when you purchase it. \u00a0The bundle is always discounted - even for the materials included. This is, in part because there is some overlap in the type of resources offered in the \u00a0products as I like to use a consistent format in my classroom to build independence.\n\n<strong>THE EXCITING PART</strong>- By purchasing the bundle, you get to download any future additions to the bundle FOR FREE!\n\nEach time I add a new product, the price of the bundle will reflect the added value, so the earlier you buy, the more bonus materials you get!\n\n<em><strong>MORE EXCITING NEWS</strong></em>- Since there is some overlap, I also include bundle bonus materials with many of the packs just as an extra \"Thank You!\"\n\nRight now, the bundle includes 4 book companions, and several pages of bonus materials, but in June, I will be adding another book companion (and the price will increase)...

It seems, however, that my children would rather have these days every day... in front of the TV. I relax a little more on their allowable TV and video game time during the summer, but I can see how quickly it's turning their imaginations into mush.\n\nIn fact, you would think that some terrible act of cruelty is happening in my house when their \"TV time\" is over. I turn the TV off and they sit for the first 10-20 minutes whining on the couch that there's nothing to do.\n\nHow have I been combating this unbearable whining? At first,I listed all of the fun things they have access to (there's this place called a yard, and there's this green stuff called grass that you can RUN AROUND IN), all of the toys in their toy room, and any artsy projects I could think of. When this failed, I was tempted to lock myself in my bedroom. Then I contemplated convincing my husband that I needed to run out to the store. Finally, I decided I better find a way to face it head on.\n\nIt was born out of frustration and exhaustion...\n\nI'll call it the \"Drop and Run\" method.\n\nEach day, I just randomly take out some kind of creative activity or material, leave it on the table and walk away.\u00a0 My children, who previously declared each activity to be \"ultimately boring\"... are spending so much time just creating!\n\nHere's our Model Magic today... so far we have:\n\n*Magic dragon chairs\n\n*Splat balls\n\n*Zitzer snakes (3 year olds love to coin new words)\n\n*and rainbows\n\nIt's so fun watching their imaginations come alive again.\n\nHere's a picture from our creations today.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/image1.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-442 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/image1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"image1\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nI know that I'll fly through the craft supplies in our cabinet, but I'll keep searching for new ways to battle Bored Brain :-)",

    "content": "I've just posted a brand new Watermelon fun pack.\n\nIt's inspired by the super cute clip art of <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Educlips\">EduClips</a>, one of my favorite summer stories written by Greg Pizzoli, and my own unwritten (until now) tale.\n\nWatermelon is delicious, sweet, a tasty treat... and the fear of watermelon those-big black seeds -also haunted my childhood. I blame it on my dad. He innocently, I suppose, told me that if you ate the black watermelon seeds, a watermelon would grow in your tummy. \u00a0He went so far as to say that the white seeds were fine, but not the black ones.\n\nLittle did he know, I had already eaten one prior to his warning.\n\nTick tock tick tock... I \u00a0waited and waited, checking my tummy in the mirror constantly. The next morning I felt fine. I decided to share the good news with my dad. I told my dad that I had eaten a seed and nothing happened. That was when he said the words... simple to an adult, but a life sentence to a child...\"Oh... it takes seven years to grow.\" \u00a0There was no smirk, no tell tale wink, just a stone serious face. I didn't say anything, didn't express concern, just walked away.\n\nDays passed and soon the fear didn't consume me, but each time I saw a watermelon, it returned. I never mentioned it again.\n\nUntil fifth grade. we were having a class party and someone brought a big bowl of watermelon. I approached my teachers desk and whispered \"Is it true if you eat a black seed a watermelon grows in your tummy in seven years?\" She smiled, and gently chuckled. \"No dear, it's not true, they just don't taste very good.\" ...and a sigh of relief.\n\nI know... I know... I'm being dramatic again.\n\nI feel like I should give some kind of disclaimer. My dad did not regularly torture me in this way. In fact, I never asked him about it again, so he had no way of knowing how often I thought of it. I love my dad dearly. He has always been, and continues to be a huge part of \u00a0my life and my children's lives. He is kind, caring, generous, and a very very hard worker. He is funny, a creator of silly made up words, and teller of silly tales (if only I knew the tale of the watermelon was one of them).\n\nIn 2013, that little crocodile make his grand appearance in The Watermelon Seed and it felt as if he was telling my story! If only I had thought to burp- ;-) . \u00a0 Since then it has become one of my all time favorite end of the year and summer stories.\n\nNow, thanks to (sarcastic) GMO watermelon without the seeds AND the story <em>The Watermelon Seed</em>, I can enjoy the tasty summer treat panic-free.\n\nCheck out the pack <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Watermelon-1956348\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Watermelon-1956348\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-468 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/watermelon-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Watermelon Fun resources! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>I've included research companion, comprehension, writing, and even a math resource!<a href=\"http://www.teachersnotebook.com/product/PrintablePrompts/watermelon\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-469 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/watermelon-story-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Watermelon Fun resources! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.teachersnotebook.com/product/PrintablePrompts/watermelon\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-470 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/watermelon-roll-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Watermelon Fun resources! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.teachersnotebook.com/product/PrintablePrompts/watermelon\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-471 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/watermelon-report-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Watermelon Fun resources! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;",

According to our clock, with 2 little boys and countless rest stops, it was closer to 17. Either way, we had so many fun adventures!\n\nA few of our favorite MUST SEE's if you are headed that way are:\n\n1. The BEACH!

It was incredible!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8476.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-496\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8476-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8476\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8484.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-495\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8484-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8484\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8503.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-494\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8503-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8503\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\n4. Family Kingdom- This amusement park is right across the street from the beach. \u00a0It had more rides than I could count for my little ones, both between 32-52 inches. \u00a0Many of those rides did have a maximum height of 52, so my 51\" tall son was a little sad he would outgrow them by next time! One of the best things about this place is that you can either purchase a ride band (for about 30 bucks) and ride unlimited rides, or you can purchase tickets ( 1 something each) and most rides are between 2 and 5 tickets. If you don't want to ride, you don't have to pay at all! We also found out that they offer a local discount, so my grandparents were able to take advantage of that!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8615.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-492\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8615-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8615\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8588.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-493\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8588-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8588\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n5. Market Commons- This place reminded me of a really unique shopping mall. It is arranged in a \"block\" rather than strip mall format and had wonderful shops and restaurants. Our favorite part was the Movie theater, with stadium seating, comfy leather chairs, and excellent matinee prices. We finally saw the Minions movie, which the boys loved. It was a great way to escape the heat!\n\n6. Joe's Diner by the Airport- Yes that's really the name of this cute little diner. The service was excellent and the food was good. It has the perfect southern diner feel. We really enjoyed it!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8658.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-488\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8658-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8658\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8659.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-487\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8659-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8659\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\n7. Carolina Roadhouse- This was one of our favorite places to eat. I ordered the Killer Dog, simply because it's their specialty. Apparently foot long hot dogs there are quite a bit thicker and meatier than here! I felt full just from looking at it! The prices were reasonable and the service was awesome!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8653.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-490\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8653-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8653\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nI know this is a teaching blog, but I, for one, wait all year long for the chance to enjoy summer fun like this!",

I prefer to print all the prompts together along with some of the Back to School paper templates for free choice writing. In the past, I've started off by asking everyone to write about the same thing. For second graders, you could even print this journal and have students choose over the course of the month to complete writing at their own pace.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/September-Writing-1984311\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-503 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/september-writing-constitution-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"September Writing Activities! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nTopics included are:\n\n-Back to school\n\n-Beginning of Fall\n\n-Labor Day\n\n-Constitution Day\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/September-Writing-1984311\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-502 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/september-writing-blank-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"September Writing Activities! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\nThe Make a List pages are great for beginning of the year centers.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/September-Writing-1984311\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-505 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/september-writing-lunch-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"September Writing Activities! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nI also like to include the card writing templates.

Whether you're commenting on how much you love the product (it feels good to be acknowledged for your work!) or have a suggestion, this feedback can help creators to improve the product or to shape future products.\n\n<strong>Why now?</strong>\n\nOne of my favorite clip art artists,<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Krista-Wallden\" target=\"_blank\"> Krista Wallden </a>had a freebie chain going for some of her super cute, very professional, and very versatile clip art. \u00a0If she got just 600 feedback on each freebie, she would produce another.\n\nWhat happened? The chain ended after a few weeks because the goal was not reached. You're probably thinking that 600 is a lot of feedback to get in a week. The problem is that the freebie has over 2.300 downloads. I was kind of bummer that only about 1/4 of people who downloaded this product took the time to leave feedback. In the case of clip art, these images are often being used to create a product that may NOT even be free (which is fine), but the least you can do is give the author credit for their awesome work by taking a minute to leave feedback.\n\nI felt so disappointed, but then wondered how aware I had been, in the past, about leaving feedback for freebies.I know when I download paid products, my purchases page has a little spot to leave feedback, and I'm looking for those TPT credits. I had never noticed that TPT catalogs all of your free purchases here as well, so you are able to access and go back to redownload or leave feedback on past purchases.\n\nSo why am I spending so much time doing it? Because I was guilty! I have downloaded hundreds of freebies and left feedback on less than a fourth of them. My frenzy is my effort to right this wrong :-). I'll keep going until every freebie I've downloaded has feedback.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Follow these 4 steps to join me on my FREEBIE FEEDBACK FRENZY!</strong></em></p>\nClick on MY TPT at the top of your login page.

On a freebie, however, I always prefer to contact the seller privately with suggestions or issues instead of leaving poor feedback.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/school-year-resolutions.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-534 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/school-year-resolutions-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"school-year-resolutions\" width=\"403\" height=\"403\" /></a>\nI've always said we are lucky, as teachers, to get two new years.\n\nI'll admit the one that feels most like \"New Year\" to me is the beginning of each school year. It's how my salary is calculated, benefits are paid, and life \"begins again\" each September with a new group of students. It's also a lot easier for me to keep these resolutions because the start of each new school year is the start of new routines, a chance to leave old habits behind. As a mom, it's also incredibly overwhelming. I'm struggling to be good at more than one thing at a time as it is (Can any person truly balance being a super mom, rockstar teacher, health enthusiast, meticulous housekeeper, and financial guru?) . \u00a0During the summer I do pretty well managing the housekeeping and mom part, but the rest goes by the wayside (These add-your-own-toppings Froyo places are my weak spot.)\n\nSo here's to a new year. A chance to start new.\n\nHere are my School Year Resolutions inspired by some of my favorite songs:\n\n*\"Let It Go\"- let the dust go, let the laundry go ( or stay in the clean laundry baskets instead of folding), let the dreams of a pinterest worthy classroom set up go. If I can let them all go, I can spend less time feeling bad about myself, and more time being productive.\n\n*\"Living in the moment\" ( A Jason Mraz Favorite)- This is a biggie- and probably the most cliche one of all, but I mean this is a very specific way. Stop and listen to the special tales of a wiggly tooth from a first grader. Stop everything and play a game of Mustache Smash with my three year old, stop and listen to my seven year old go on and on (sometimes for hours) about Minecraft. The children in my life bring me such joy if I just take the time to let them no matter how busy I may feel, how many house chores need to be done, or how crunched I feel for assessments.\n\n*\"Shake it Off\"- Students, parents, administrators, colleagues, and even friends will do and say things that are frustrating or even *pout* hurt my feelings. Shake it off. People hardly do this on purpose, and if they do, then it's more their problem than mine. I don't do so well with this one. I take things personally... and I need to stop, which is why this is one of my school year resolutions in the first place.\n\n*\"I need a little sweetness in my life\"- Notice how I said \"a little\". I have a major chocolate in my top drawer problem. So... this is one of my biggest day-to-day-changes. I am going to try packing something in my lunch (a hershey kiss) and that's it. Yes, I realize this could totally backfire and result in my indulging in chocolate at all hours of the night... we'll see how it goes :-)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo cheers to a new school year!",

When the children step on the spot, they tell that part of the story!\n\nThe best part is that they adhere to carpet well, don't leave behind residue, and you can vacuum right over top of them.

In Connecticut, we begin on August 26, so my classroom is all set up, and just one weekend and two PD days stand between me and another wonderful group of first graders.\n\nIn my district we don't have a prescribed math program, and I choose to use guided math groups as my approach to math instruction. What I have found in the past is that a lot of resources we have include an activity and maybe an independent practice (usually very long for the kiddos), but hardly any include a game or extension that is a perfect fit for the kiddos working \u00a0independently.\n\nSoo... you guessed it! I've been busy creating my own resources for each focus in our mathematics curriculum.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Subtraction-Within-10-2047958\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/subtract-within-10-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Subtraction within 10 printable practice, games, and activities! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nToday I finished, and posted Subtraction Within 10.

It's the End of Summer Blues. \u00a0It actually lasts longer than a day ....\u00a0In fact, I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel this way all week long. \u00a0I am sad to have to share \u00a0my children with the world and not find joy in their eyes during every minute of every day (although I know I must). I am sad not to sit at our new breakfast bar and have a coffee with my husband in the morning (School mornings are so rushed!), and I am sad not to be able to stay up until 2 am watching episodes of Mad Men (my new favorite show).\n\nThen I sometimes feel guilty for feeling sad. After all, I have the best job in the world! I love my job. And how many people get to take summers off to enjoy these moments I love so much? Sometimes I spend my time feeling guilty about being sad. \u00a0It's my teacher guilt creeping up on me.\n\nSo after all week of having all these feelings... I am going to come out and say it.\n\n<strong><em>Feeling this way does not mean I am a bad teacher!</em></strong>\n\nIt does not mean that I am not thankful for the time I do have off, It's just the way I feel.\n\n-Feeling this way means I am more than a teacher. I pour so much of my heart and soul into my students each school year that these moments when I can just BE with my family are precious and so appreciated. It is not wrong to be sad to have to divide my time. We say goodbye to so many things at the end of the summer.\n\nI know I'll say hello to wonderful things too.\n\nTomorrow I will be filled with excitement and anticipation as I greet all of my fellow teachers in the morning. It will be filled with nervousness and to do lists and joy as I imagine those new faces entering my room this week.\n\nBut for now, I am just feeling kind of sad about the things I'll say goodbye to.\n\nFeeling this way doesn't mean I am a bad teacher. Feeling this way means I am \u00a0human.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "The first day of school is always fun and exciting!\n\nBefore I share some of the lessons and activities for the week, I just want to say that most of these beginning ideas grew long before I joined the first grade team, so as awesome as they are, I can't take credit for creating them all :-)\n\n<strong>Arrival-</strong> This first day, I always put out a basic coloring sheet. It helps me to take \u00a0quick survey of basic fine motor, I can tell if they know how to write their names, and it keeps them busy as I greet the other children and help them get unpacked. I always like to play a little fun music when they first come in, especially since they are usually so quiet. Music definitely sets a fun mood!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Morning Meeting- I'll go into detail about my (short) morning meetings at another time)</strong>\n\nLaunch Read to Self!- Day 1: I introduce students to their book boxes. I put some easy readers in each book box, and then students choose another book from the shelf to add to their box. \u00a0We practice the 3 ways to read a book (Read the words, read the pictures, and retell). I ask them to try the first two ways on our first day of first grade. Then we spread out and the students practice this on their own for one minute.\n\nI called the students back and gave them the three expectations (Stay in my spot, Read the whole time, Quiet voice). I modeled what that looked and sounded like, along with what it did NOT look and sound like.\n\nThen students went back to practice for just 1 more minute.\n\n<strong>Snack</strong>\n\n<b>Read Aloud-\u00a0</b>I LOVE to read Chicka Chicka Boom Boom! The first day of school. I know that the kindergarten teachers at my school do a lot with it, but it's too much fun not to read!\n\nI then chart \u00a0\"_______ will be in this room\" on the easel (I write this out ahead of time).\n\nThe students take turns coming up to point to the sentence when it's their turn on the chart ( I check for 1-1 match).\n\nThen students complete a class book page \"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom _____________ will be in this room\".\n\nAll they have to do is write their name, and draw a picture. They write the letters of their name in the coconut tree on the class book page.\n\nI know this is a simple task, but it helps everyone to be together on the first day succeeding. It also helps me to collect information about the students, and helps them to learn each others names!\n\n<strong>Walk Around the School-\u00a0</strong>\n\nIt's always nice to take a little break and bring the kiddos around the school. On the first day, we practice walking in a line, and touring the school. We take this very slow so students remember (or learn, for new students) about our school.\n\n<strong>Read Aloud-</strong> I snuck a \"just for fun\" read aloud in right before lunch time.\n\nA My Name is Alice project- I read the story A My Name is Alice ( I actually read the first few pages to students, then skip around a bit). Then, we brainstorm things that begin with the first letter of each child's name\n\nI prepare the chart paper with student names:\n\nJohn likes_______________\n\nChris likes ______________\n\nThen, we fill in a word that begins with the same letter.\n\nStudents come up and practice reading this line as well. Then I display it as they complete this fun project.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI use tracers for the heads and just a half sheet of construction paper for the shirt.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9396.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-585 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9396-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9396\" width=\"403\" height=\"302\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Math-</strong> On the first day and through the first week, I like to incorporate pattern blocks for math. The students are tired, they miss their families, and playing is just what they need to do. I put pattern blocks out, divivde studetns into groups, and they have such a fun time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Magic Playdough-</strong> One of the most awaited (by me) activities of the day!\n\nFor the past two years we have made magic playdough and it has been a truly magical experience for the kiddos! Make little balls of homemade playdough, press your finger in to make a hole and hide a couple drops of food coloring inside. Close the ball up and it will look plain and white, until they start massaging around (I always have them mix it in the bag at school. The food coloring will dye your hands until it's all the way dispersed inside the play dough!)\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9395.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-595\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9395-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9395\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9394.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-596\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_9394-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9394\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI like to keep lots of read alouds handy, since you never know when you'll have an extra few minutes!\n\nThere you have it... day 1 :-)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

No matter how much time, energy, and resources I pour into my job as a teacher, I often suffer from teacher guilt. I'm going to try to be more candid about it as the year goes on. This is not to be mistaken with \"Mommy guilt\" which is another very serious condition I often suffer from.\n\nMy current bout with teacher guilt has to do with The Summer Slide.\n\nIt's the time of year I start hearing about the summer slide that my former students experienced.\n\nWhat is the summer slide? It's dropping reading levels, forgetting their ABCs , not sure how to use a + sign, for example.\n\nThis has been weighing so heavily on me today! I know it's inevitable, expected even, but I can't help but feel badly about it. I talked with some colleagues and asked a reassuring \"We're good teachers! (right?)\"\n\nWhen I got home I thought more about it.\u00a0 Thinking about it reminded me of my school year resolution to \"Let It Go\"... and when I heard that song, I thought about dancing... and when I thought about dancing, it reminded me of the time I learned and taught\u00a0 the staff\u00a0 the \"Hoedown Showdown\" for the school talent show.\n\nI sat in front of videos of youtube stumbling around like a lunatic. Slowly I began to get it. After time I could dance it in my sleep ... But then time passed. I heard the song, and sort of remembered the motions, but I certainly was stumbling around once again. This time, instead of taking weeks to learn the moves, it took me just a few run throughs. Don't know what I mean? Learn\u00a0 it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTOFYlfFYeI\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>! (Yes I was just dancing in my living room).\n\nSo i'm just going to say it- Reading is a lot like learning to dance.\u00a0 The children watch, they follow your models, follow your tips, try it out piece by piece, and before long they're \"performers\". When summer comes and they're missing out on that direct instruction, daily rigorous practice (we read A LOT in my classroom),they come back kind of remembering the moves, but stumbling to put them together.\n\nSo here's to hoping that after a few run throughs, they are back up to speed...and\u00a0I'm going to do my best to \"Let It Go\".\n\n&nbsp;",

I also get terrible migraines, so this is a super tough time of year in that regard. Any time there is a break, I seek shelter in one of the few air conditioned rooms in the building and sit. At the end of the day, I can't leave quickly enough... which is a problem! First grade is a busy place! I am finding myself feeling really overwhelmed with all of the little things that need to be done and the piles that are already forming behind and on my desk.\n\nIt's the feeling like all of your tasks are buzzing around your head and distracting you from even being able to speak intelligibly. So, how do you cope? Make a list!\u00a0We call this a \"Bee List\" in my house.

Last year, I had tons of kiddos copy the words from their webs on their writing pages in a list, instead of forming sentences with them.\n\nThis year I went to teach the same lesson, in the moment remembered that struggle from last year, and thought of how I could help my first graders understand that their web idea was just where they \"caught\" their small ideas, like a spider would catch a fly.\n\nToday's topic was writing about a special birthday!\n\nWe brainstormed together, students completed their own webs with words like \"cake, party, friends, \u00a0 candy, fun, beach, restaurant\"\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9389.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-591 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9389-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9389\" width=\"348\" height=\"261\" /></a>\n\nThen, when it came time to write, I had the students catch their ideas (choose one), whisper it into their clasped hands, shake their hands and ask \"What is it I wanted to write about 'party'? Oh yes, I wanted to write 'I had a party. ' See how my idea grew?\"\n\nThe students then practiced it, and it was incredible! Each student wrote complete thoughts about the ideas on their web organizers. I don't know if this will continue to work, but it's exciting enough to write about.\n\nI tell my class that there's a lot of magic in first grade. Growing our ideas was one of those first grade magic moments :-)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe also made cute little birthday cakes during the hot afternoon hours, when the main goal is to be still and stay hydrated! I'll display these on the back bulletin board for the kids to see. It's a nice addition to our All About Me unit. It's also amazing how many of them learn their birthday on this day!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9392.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-592 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9392-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9392\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>",

    "content": "Happy (Almost) Friday!\nI am in my third week of using the <a href=\"http://www.sitspots.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SitSpots</a> in my classroom and I can already see a HUGE difference with my students and management of routines in comparison to last year!\n\nI figured that the <a href=\"http://www.sitspots.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SitSpots</a> would help me keep students in their own personal space. I also figured that they would help me prevent the \"creeper uppers\" I always have when it's time for a lesson or story, you know, the kids who end up sitting on your toes as you read. \u00a0I really struggled with how to arrange the dots. Would I place them in a circle, which is how we normally sit for meeting (but some kiddos have their backs to the board?). Would I place them in staggered rows, like the students often sit for a story? I'd hate for the kids to be so far away when I am reading a good story to them. \u00a0In spite of my worries, I decided to start with a circle. \u00a0Boy am I glad I did!\n\nI never imagined how much the simple <a href=\"http://www.sitspots.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SitSpot</a> circle would offer me as a teacher.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9399.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-582 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9399-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9399\" width=\"359\" height=\"269\" /></a>5 Reasons I love the <a href=\"http://www.sitspots.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SitSpot</a> circle in my classroom\n\n1. It helps the students know where to go (just like the motto says!). No more crooked circles, with some boys and girls squeezed out, or left behind for morning meeting! I also use these at the end of the day. Once students have packed their things, they find a spot. \u00a0Everyone has a place to be!\n\n2. The SitSpot Strategy! They help me, help my students make good seating choices. I'm sure you have it in your classroom too! Johnny and Jeffrey are both wonderful, but they are even more wonderful when they are not seated anywhere near each other. Behold, the SitSpot strategy! I assign both of them to blue dots and VOILA! neither one is next to the other!\n\n3. Students can sit \"on\" or \"inside\" the circle. Although I thought originally that having the dots in a circle would limit their use to morning meeting and maybe dismissal, I found that telling the students to sit inside the circle for a story, has been an amazing thing. Every year I have table lingerers. They always slouch away and try to lean on a table, or sit all crouched down underneath \u00a0a chair (which usually leads to silly and distracting behavior). Well, problem solved. During \u00a0a story, lesson, or any other time I need the students sitting in a group, they all sit inside the circle.\n\n4. I use the spots for other times of day too! We use parts of The Daily 5 approach in my classroom. Read to Self is one of the very important parts of our day. Most of the students know just where their (imaginary) spots are around the room. I do have a few students who really need a literal SPOT in order to know where to stay during this time of the day. Giving them spots on opposite sides of the circle has helped them during that time of day.\n\n5. They brighten up my classroom. I know this is a silly one, but look how bright and fun they are?!?! They are much more inviting than masking tape, that's for sure!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n(You might be wondering about the center spot. We use this for shared materials during math center time. Sometimes I have a group work on the floor, so the basket or bin of shared materials stays on the dot, and the students stay inside the circle!)\n\nSo originally I was going to move these spots around as the kids got used to the routines so I could use them for centers and other activities, but I may have to find a way to get myself some different shapes to use for those purposes because so far, I am in love with my SitSpot circle!\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "So the first day has come and gone, and it's time to really start discussing classroom and school expectations.\n\nWe use the PBIS approach to behavior management in my school (which I love!). This involves really explicit modeling of expectations throughout the school. In our school, we teach students how to be Kind, Responsible, Respectful, and Ready throughout the day, from the bus line, to the classroom, to specials, to the cafeteria!\n\nIn the classroom, we do a lot more than just one lesson when we discuss expectations for the year. One of my favorite books and characters is David!\n\nWe read No David, and then David Goes to School. We brainstorm advice for David on a chart on the board.\n\nThen, students create their own David's and write a piece of advice on a sentence strip below! My team has been doing this project for a long time, and the students love it year after year!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5a6facea7c8d4c0bf97ee1c6b8fc7c78.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-589 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5a6facea7c8d4c0bf97ee1c6b8fc7c78-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"5a6facea7c8d4c0bf97ee1c6b8fc7c78\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen, we write our Class Promise, using the 4 areas of our school motto. \u00a0I like to take pictures of the students doing things that are kind, responsible, respectful and ready the first couple of weeks, and display the photos around the class promise! This is good motivation to be doing the right thing, and is also a fun way to make the children feel right at home from the beginning of the year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI also read a couple of other great books the first week. The most difficult thing for first graders is to listen to the speaker. They have so many very important things to say! These two stories are great for your interrupters!\n\n<img class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pCtTo%2B7PL._SY410_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">And</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aI5PzwK3L._SY434_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>",

    "content": "Hello there! On this wonderful Columbus day weekend, I am finally taking the time to sit down and collect some of my thoughts about the first several weeks of school.\n\nThis year, our professional focus (SLO and all) in first grade is on math. This is kind of a strange feeling, since I feel like most of the emphasis on what I do each day involves, reading... but we're going to go with it anyway!\n\nIn addition, we don't really have a district math program, so we're always creating and finding our own things to use to meet the math standards.\n\nI have a few students in my class who struggle to complete a large work load. One of the modifications I've often done is to have them complete less problems, or at least include less problems on a page. They notice.\n\nThe fact that their page has been cut in half, or looks different becomes the topic of their interest rather than the math.\n\nAnd still, these struggling students were not very focused \u00a0or motivated (this may also have to do with the fact that we have math at the very end of the day).\n\nOn a whim last week, I decided to try this approach.\n\nI know kids LOVE sticky notes, so I decided to try Mystery Math.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9945.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-621\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_9945-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9945\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nBefore we got started, I covered each problem with a small sticky note. My instruction was for them to pick a mystery math problem and then solve it! These students were super serious and super focused. In fact, the two students I tried this approach with both finished the entire activity.\n\nI speculate it worked so well because:\n\n1.The page was not visually overwhelming with problems.\n\n2.They had the CHOICE of which problem to complete.\n\n3. Kids love sticky notes.\n\nAnyway, I have formatted several of the pages in my\nAddition and Subtraction packs to be compatible with this type of approach.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Subtraction-Within-10-2047958\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-454 alignleft\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/addition-within-10-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"addition-within-10-cover\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-546 alignleft\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/subtract-within-10-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"subtract-within-10-cover\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Addition-And-Subtraction-within-10-2047993\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-551 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/AdditionSubtractionwithin10-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Addition&amp;Subtractionwithin10\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>",

The card writing templates, for example, are always a student favorite!\n\nThree versions are available- 1 half paged writing with a picture space (dotted lines), two page writing (single line) and a draw to respond version.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1437 size-full\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/original-2144174-3.jpg\" alt=\"October printable journal prompts offered in three journal versions make it easy to find the just the right template for all of your writers.

They \"don't know what to write\". They \"don't know what to draw\" and they \"don't know what to say\", when the answer is not directly in front of them or clear.\n\nThey have also had some trouble getting along kindly with one another. There are lots of \"That's not fair!\"comments coming from them instead of celebrating accomplishments of one another.\n\nSo here we go with part-by-part- ways to help build this community and \"the whole child.\"",

    "content": "Mystery Bag Challenges!\n\nTwice during the week, I gave my students Mystery Bags! Inside, there were a number of arts and craft type materials. Their challenge was to create something together using the materials.\n\nAll throughout the week, we added to a list of \"What Makes A Good Friend &amp; Partner\".\n\nWe were able to add things before and after each activity.\n\nFor the first activity, I gave students pipe cleaners, tin foil, and cotton balls in a paper bag.\nThey had 10 minutes to create something with their partner. I didn't expect them to use the bags, but many of them did! Pictured below is Rainbow Town, Spider Hut, and a fishing boat with a shark.\n\n!<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0344.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-648\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0344-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0344\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0345.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-649\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0345-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0345\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0349.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-650\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0349-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0349\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nI LOVE how this activity encouraged the children to negotiate with each other. They decided to add \"Patience, Listening, and compromise\" (after I taught this word to match what they were describing) to our list of Good Friend/ Good Partner work.\n\nWe did another challenge with clay, a paper plate, and a mystery object (different for each group). I didn't take any pictures, but they worked together even more smoothly this time. It surprised me how many students didn't know what to do with clay though. \u00a0I think next time i'll give each group a little more time to explore their materials before getting started.\n\nAll of this was combined with our informational study of owls. At the end of the week, after learning and writing all about owls, the students used these wonderful Nocturnal Animals books by Pebble publisher to research and make a poster about a nocturnal animal. We took out the list of Good Friend/Good Partners behaviors before getting started which reminded them to use their working together skills when completing academic tasks too!\n\nHere is some of their work!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0427.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-651\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0427-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0427\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0428.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-652\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0428-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0428\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0429.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-653\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0429-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0429\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0430.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-654\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0430-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0430\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0431.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-655\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0431-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0431\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0432.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-656\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0432-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0432\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>",

    "content": "Teaching my Gingerbread Activities was probably my favorite part of the entire year so far!\nWe started by reading the Gingerbread Man story and creating a story mat to practice retelling. We really focused on the characters and setting in the creation of the story mat.\n\nThen we wrote letters to the gingerbread man telling him whether he should run away or not.\n\nThen, we read another version Keep Running Gingerbread Man, and retold that story using our mat as well. Doing both retellings helped the students to compare the stories with lots of detail!\n\nSAVE THE GINGERBREAD MAN DAY!\nOn Friday, we celebrated SAVE THE GINGERBREAD MAN DAY! We began by discussing the problem in the story of the Gingerbread Man. IN all the stories we read, the Gingerbread Man had trouble when he got to the river. We made lists of ways to save the Gingerbread man (yes superman and Spider Webs were allowed on these lists, along with portals and Enderdragons).\n\nThen, I posed the \"crossing the river problem\", the students had some materials and they had to try to engineer some way to get the Gingerbread Man across. It was at this point that we narrowed down to real life engineering solutions.\n\nThe kids LOVED IT!\nTo end the week, they rewrote the ending to the story, where the Gingerbread man was heroically saved by a catapult, boat, or hidden bridge (depending on their creations). It was an awesome week! Check out the resources I used !\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Story-Activities-2277354\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-691 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gingerbread-stories-cover-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Gingerbread Story Activities\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>",

I am trying to be better about posting, but you know.... the life of a teacher!\n\nWell, when I taught third grade, <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/New-Year-Literacy-Activity-Poem-and-Writing-A-Gift-To-The-World-1612788\" target=\"_blank\">I wrote a little poem, and created a really fun and thoughtful project for the kiddos to do</a>. \u00a0Now that I am in in first grade, we are always sharing new and fun ideas.\n\nThis year, I used resources created by any awesome member of my teaching team, Tara Hardink, \u00a0to do our New Year writing.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_717\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/New-Years-2016-2282971\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"wp-image-717 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-2282971-1-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"New Year 2016 writing Freebie!\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> Click here to get it for free![/caption]\n\nMy students used the cut and glue model along with some circle tracers, that I use several times a year, \u00a0to make their faces. At the beginning of the year, one of my super parents donated some really cool textured and printed card stock, so that's what we used for the background of the tracers. \u00a0I also added some party squawkers for fun (did you know that's what those shiny things are called? I didn't!). \u00a0The students had tons of fun thinking of ideas, warmed up those fine motor skills with the cutting, and were super detailed in the pictures of their faces.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1413.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-718 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1413-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"New Year Writing!\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1412.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-719 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1412-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"New Year Writing\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1410.jpg\"><img class=\"  aligncenter wp-image-720\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1410-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"New Year Writing!\" width=\"368\" height=\"276\" /></a>Happy New Year!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Check out Tara's new blog <a href=\"http://myfirstgradezoo.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>!</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

After looking long and hard for a desk for our new home office and thinking we would have to break the bank to get what we wanted, he decided to design and build.\n\nI am in LOVE! It's a 10 foot shared desk for the two of us (he works from home).\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1238.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-723\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1238-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1238\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1181.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-724\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_1181-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1181\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is even enough space for my two boys to squeeze in between us as we work!\n\nWhen sharing of the desk pictures with my friends and colleagues many of them asked \"Wait, how may computers do you have?\"\n\nThe answer- One desktop and one laptop- 2 monitors for each.\n\nSo i'll let you in on a little secret that my super handy husband and the rest of the computer community has been keeping from us for a long time- 2 monitors are better than one.\n\nTPT TIP:\n\nHook up 2 monitors to your computer and adjust the display in the settings ( your computer must have a video card that supports 2 displays). Your mouse will be able to move from monitor to monitor and even drag things back and forth.\n\nHow do I use this super cool feature as a TPT seller?\n\nI open up my clip art files on the right monitor and the packet I am working on on the left monitor. No more clicking back and forth, clicking the \"insert image\" and then scrolling through all my clip art. I just have the folder open on the right side, copy, and paste right into my projects.\n\nIt's a TPT time saver for sure! \u00a0It helps me edit packets, add graphics, and even work from some of the templates I have to customize for the topic I am working on.\n\nSo there you have it... a TPT tip (and best kept secret).\n\nHappy New Year!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "Fill in the blank how you may, the beginning of the year is ALWAYS eventful!\n\nI have been SO bad at updating my blog and working on new resources!\n\nHere are 5 adjectives I would use in the blank so far (take them as excuses if you will).\n\nWhat a <strong>busy\u00a0</strong>start to the year!\n\n-We begin January with assessments... lots and lots of them. We check in on their sight words, reading progress, \u00a0spelling \u00a0(twice) , reading comprehension, and writing. The month has flown by!\n\nWhat a <strong>stressful</strong>\u00a0start to the year!\n\n-This month I have been a member of a committee reviewing potential math resources for our elementary level students across our district's three schools. \u00a0Taking time away from the classroom to hear vendors is extremely time consuming. Seriously, writing up sub plans is more difficult than just going in to teach myself.\n\nWhat an <strong>overwhelming</strong> start to the year!\n\n-This month I also \"volunteered\" to be observed as a part of instructional rounds in my classroom. This meant ALL district administrators from ALL school levels (about 16 of them) passed through my classroom observing in 10 minute blocks. First graders, of course, are intrigued by this. Of course we are told this is \"non evaluative\", but I care about my job and success, so it was quite overwhelming preparing and just waiting for it to be OVER!\n\nWhat a <strong>noisy</strong> time of year!\n\nIs it just me, or do all students come back from break with SO much to say and share... for days and days and days. The chitter chatter of a productive classroom is something I embrace, but this is a whole new level of noisy. \u00a0I blame it on the cold weather and indoor or shortened recess, but I know it's probably got a lot to do with their growing friendships and getting back into our routine.\n\nWhat an <strong>exciting</strong> start to the year!\n\nWe have had an awesome and exciting beginning to the year! We have worked on some of my favorite units (bears and other winter animals, snowmen, and MAGNETS!) We had an awesome visitor come to present to the kiddos about magnets and it feels so good to watch their eyes widen as they make new hands on discoveries. It is also the time of year when we begin writer's workshop, so that's pretty exciting too! Tomorrow is also the 100th day of school for us, so I am busy planning for the fun first grade happenings that we enjoy on the 100th day! (more to come about that!). It's also my BEST TPT month and I am so excited to watch my little shop grow!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have also decided to try something different, I am going to try to post some \u00a0parts of my freebies , to save you a step when it comes to accessing them online! We are toying with more advances to the blog.\n\nHere is my first ever freebie!

It's going to be a busy one for sure!\n\nI have been working on a couple of fun Valentine's activities in these past days/ weeks.\n\nFirst, here is a fun 10 frame math pack.

There are 4 different spinners so you can differentiate for different groups. There are also a number of recording pages so you can choose the activity that is just right for your students. It includes adding, adding 3 numbers, fact families, and multiplication.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Valentines-Day-Math-Center-2377167\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-753 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Spin-and-Solve-Valentines-Day-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Spin and Solve- Valentines Day. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Valentines-Day-Math-Center-2377167\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-754 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Spin-and-Solve-Valentines-Day-fact-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Spin and Solve- Valentines Day. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLastly, I posted a freebie!

    "content": "Hello again! I totally promised to do this more often, but I'm finding it so difficult to keep up with everything, so I'll post as I go.\n\nOne of my favorite ways to work with informational books with my first graders is with a focus on vocabulary. I know that some of the words in the text will be difficult (or impossible) for them to decode as they read.\n\nI know that in the past I have sometimes just told them what words were and what they meant, even shown them a picture.\n\nThis strategy, however, is one of my FAVORITES!\n\nSince it's February, we have been focusing on learning about dental health. We have this awesome set of paired texts that is all about teeth. Before reading, I want the children to already be thinking about the words, so I put some of the \"tricky\" words on index cards in one color, and put the definitions in another \u00a0color. The children then practice reading the content word and they try to match the word with the definition. This often times causes them to access prior knowledge, introduces the word including practice seeing and reading the word, and also alerts them to listen and pay attention to key content words in the text.\n\nAs we read, we then noticed the headings on each page, read, and moved the definitions to match the words as we discovered, in the text, what the meaning of the words was.\n\nIt is a SUPER engaging way to keep kids focused on the text and to keep them thinking as they read! They are then ready to talk and share what they learned, even using these content specific vocabulary words.\n\nOne of the kiddos in this group told me the next day that he better use his molars on his fruit snacks. :-)\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/unpacking-the-common-core-informational-text/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"  aligncenter wp-image-779\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1753-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Fun way to introduce and extend understanding of informational vocabulary!\" width=\"391\" height=\"293\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo...

The weather has been wild. We went from -10 degrees just two days ago to snow yesterday, and rain and wind with a temp of around 50 today. I notice because I've stolen a bit of time each day to finalize some new resources to share with you!\n\nFrog and Toad are some of my favorite characters ever. Arnold Lobel crafted these books to\u00a0offer a great opportunity to see which students think critically and which students believe everything they read without question, and I use them as an opportunity to bridge the kiddos to think critically about the text.\n\nOne way, is by having guiding chapter questions. I have included three types of activities for each chapter with a journal cover so you can really customize these packs for your class.\n\nI offer a variety of questions for students to respond to in writing on the first \"typical\" question page. The second page for each chapter offers a write and draw component (more critical thinking) and a connection component, which sometimes connects vocabulary as well and MY FAVORITE PART- Find, Mark, Discuss. I pass out sticky notes to the students and they carry this question throughout the entire book, collecting evidence and thinking about the characters. This discussion is done all orally, which I know drives some of my teacher friends crazy (\"How do you KNOW they understand if they didn't write about it?\"). If you listen and see what kinds of evidence the students are sharing, you know pretty quickly which students understand. I also love this question because it gets the kiddos back into the text to support their answers.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Frog-and-toad-all-year-chapter.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-796 alignleft\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Frog-and-toad-all-year-chapter-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Frog-and-toad-all-year-chapter\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Frog-and-toad-all-year-chapter1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-797 alignleft\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Frog-and-toad-all-year-chapter1-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Frog-and-toad-all-year-chapter1\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nI have also offered a couple of generic activities if you want to mix it up.

    "title": "Do I Need a Book Test? Assessing Reading Comprehension",
    "content": "A reading some blogs, and reviewing some feedback and suggestions for some of my comprehension novel study resources, \u00a0a question has come up a few times. \"Why didn't you include a book test?\"\n\nMany times, the questions and feedback of others helps me to shape my resources. It helps me to know and understand what teachers are looking for. In this case, I feel a little differently.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Chocolate-Touch-1786001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0</a><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ca332ba8-f4f8-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/chocolate-touch-novel-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-270 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-chocolate-touch-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Chocolate Touch comprehension pack. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ca332ba8-f4f8-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/chocolate-touch-novel-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-271 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-chocolate-touch1-chapter-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Chocolate Touch Comprehension. blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nThe short answer to this question \" Will you be adding a book test\" is No. The reason really is that my vision for my resources, the types of lessons I share, and the way I teach does not include book tests. \u00a0In fact, if I am totally honest, although I include a page of chapter questions for each chapter, I don't even actually use these questions with every chapter, every time.\n\nSo how do I know that my students really comprehended the book? I talk to them. I listen to their discussions. In fact, the \"Find, Mark, Discuss\" question located in many of my packs is often the one directed question we answer, and often not in writing until the end of the book. In fact, my overall \"assessment\" when I taught third grade and used The Chocolate Touch in my classroom, was the question \"Was the Chocolate Touch a blessing or a curse?\" If you ask this question throughout the story, collect evidence as you go (find, mark, and discuss prompt), and then look at how students responded, you'll know whether they \"got it\" or \"not\".\n\nI just feel like book tests are a lot of pressure, and are not a natural part of building readers. We can do a lot more by asking them to discuss, and answer questions. For some teachers, book tests are an important part of their reading block, and they're not for mine.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">My goal in this little journey of mine is to share my approach, share my resources, and share little successes (and activities that go well) along the way.</p>\n\n<aside id=\"text-14\" class=\"widget widget_text\">\n<div class=\"textwidget\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.**\n\n</div>\n</aside>If you don't have the book yet, here's my affiliate link to one!\n\n&lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0688161332/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0688161332&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=printableprom-20&amp;linkId=53fc2fcfdf36ba3d4cb6418054077fa3\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=0688161332&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=printableprom-20\" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=printableprom-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0688161332\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /&gt;",

It's pretty cool what you can see in just a few minutes! \n\n<img src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Catch-a-snowflake.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1525\" />\nYou can even throw in some procedural writing or observational writing as a response!\n\n\n3.How Does A Snowflake Form?\nCreate a \"life of a snowflake\" wheel!\n<img src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Copy-of-Catch-a-snowflake.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1524\" />\n\n\n4. Make a Paper Snowflake!\nOf course cutting your own snowflakes is an awesome and fun activity for students. It's also a great way to discuss fine motor skills and encourage oral discussion of the types of snowflakes to use snowflake vocabulary!\n\n\n\n5. Read like a Scientist! \nWe love to read narrative stories about snow and snowy days like scientists. Students discuss and label the images we see. If the story has a picture of a snowflake, we see if we can find the type of snowflakes we learned about. \nIt's so neat to see how students can really apply their knowledge to read snowy stories!\n\n\n\n\nThis snow printables pack is great as enrichment for science and pairs nicely with a number of snowy day picture and fact books.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Snow-2278017\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-687 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/snow-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Snow day fun resources\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>",

    "title": "8 Roll and Record Games for Math Centers!",
    "content": "One of my biggest pushes for teaching math is small group instruction with practice/ support centers . In my classroom, I use a rotation. One of the biggest challenges with this approach is the prep required to keep up with centers. Today, I'll share one of my favorite \"growing\" centers that is really no prep!\n\nI have been building Roll and Record routines to support our math activities since the beginning of the year! The best part is, I use the same recording sheet for almost all of the roll and record activities, which \u00a0helps the students focusing on practicing the new skill at hand. My students have named them \"levels\", so I'll jump on board with that in \u00a0my description.\n\n<strong>Level 1:</strong> Using \"regular\" six sided dice.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1966.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-823 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1966-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Roll and record math center! Blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can also use\u00a0dice with the numbers instead of dots. This is also a great way to build fluency using strategies other than counting the dots.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1958.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-831 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1958-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Roll and record math center! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Level 2:</strong> Counting on to add.\n\nI actually used little stickers on one die per child to create dice that have 1, 2, or 3 dots.\n\nThen they roll a die with a numeral on it, rather than the dots and one of the dotted dice to practice using counting on as a strategy.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1959.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-830 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1959-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Roll and record math center! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Level 3:</strong> Up the ante and use a 1,2, or 3 dotted die as well as a 10 sided die!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1961.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-828 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1961-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Roll and record math center! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Level 4:</strong> Practice doubles by rolling one \"regular\" die and doubling it to get the sum!\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1967.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-822 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1967-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Roll and record math center! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<strong>Level 5:</strong> Practice doubles with by rolling a 10 sided die and doubling the number!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1963.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-826 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1963-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Roll and record math center! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Level 6:</strong> Roll one 1- sided die to signify the number of 10s, and one ten sided die to signify the number of ones. Record as expanded form on the page! You can also use the fancy dice with multiples of 10 (pictured below).\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rr.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-833 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rr-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Roll and record math center! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Level 7:</strong> Adding within 100!\n\nRoll 2 10 sided dice to create a 2 digit number. Then, roll a \"regular\" six sided die to count on/ add that many more!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1851-1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-821 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1851-1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Roll and record math center! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Level 8</strong> (Where we are now!): Adding tens to a 2 digit number.\n\nRoll 2 10 sided dice to create a 2 digit number, then roll a 6 sided die and add that many tens! I actually have a die that has tens on each side (my husband used to be into Dungeons and Dragons, but that is a completely different discussion).\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1965.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-824 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1965-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Roll and record math center! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nYou can also amp this up for multiplication, have students subtract (on the write in the symbol page) the smaller number from the larger number.\n\nThese simple games are AMAZING for centers, awesome for practicing skill fluency, AND most importantly INCREDIBLE for differentiation! I have some students who are still practicing their basic facts with two 6 sided dice... they are playing the same game as their peers, just a different version!\n\nHere is <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/roll-and-record.pdf\">roll-and-record</a>\u00a0freebie pack which includes basic recording sheets!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/roll-and-record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-815\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/roll-and-record-page-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"roll-and-record-page\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/roll-and-record.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-816 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/roll-and-record-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Roll and record math center! blog.printableprompts.com\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDo you have any other suggestions?

My students are becoming so much more independent at attempting to solve problems independently. They are also really exploring which representations help them to solve problems. One great example is there is one problem that is 14-7... so many of my first graders tried to draw a ten rod and then 4 ones. Some of them were stumped as to why their representation didn't work for them. The rich math discussion that followed was an awesome fundamental regrouping discussion that was just right for them. It is awesome to see them willing to take chances, try to solve, and have confidence in sharing their solutions. They are also developing more descriptive questions, rather than \"What do I do?\", their questions sound like \"Why is there a number for an extra class on the table?\" (extra information is included in some of the problems), or \"How do I make my equation match my picture?\". \u00a0It's also helping them to think about what answering the question means.... \u00a0so many times they think the answer must be a number, but this is not so when you are asking them to compare two teams, for example.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm in love with the kind of math thinkers these journals are helping me to develop. Check out the April pack!\n\n&nbsp;",

I have two boys (now 5 and 8) and now we are expecting a little girl in February. As a result I spent the entire summer sick in bed.\n\nI also found out just a couple of weeks before the school year began that I Was going to be transferred to a new school (still first grade). I am really enjoying all of the new learning opportunities that come with being a part of a new team, and they are beyond supportive. I also miss my old team, classroom, and routines. It's been very busy just trying to keep up with the school stuff, especially with my lower energy level.\n\nMy youngest son also has terrible asthma, which has been exacerbated by the shared germs of a 22 new kindergarten friends in his class.\n\nSo ... it's been a wild start!\n\nI've also been pouting a bit since the TPT algorithm change, which totally cut my sales about in 1/3 of what they had been previously, so instead of creating new things to post, I've been trying to research and figure out how to make my products more searchable to the right audience!\n\nI am ready now to begin sharing about some of the fun that comes with the first months of school, so stay tuned for more to come!\n\n&nbsp;",

    "title": "5 Things I've Learned as a Teacher Mom",
    "content": "<strong>1. Saying Yes to my child really does make a difference.</strong>\n\nJust today my kindergartner \u00a0came home so excited. Yesterday he forgot his lunchbox at school, so he had to bring the old spare today with his lunch. When he got to school, he wanted to move all of his lunch things over to his real lunchbox... and his teacher helped him do it, She has 16 other 5-6 year olds to care for and- let's not forget- educate, but taking two minutes to help him with his lunchbox dilemma made a big difference to him.\n\n<i>Now I'm sorry for all of those little missed \"yes\" opportunities I've lost with my students over the years.\u00a0</i>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>2. The little things we say do matter!</strong>\n\nMy fourth grader had a ridiculously difficult third grade experience. This year, in fourth grade he has had an AMAZING teacher. After watching him doodle and work on his craft as a writer, she told him \"I sure hope you invite me to your first comic book signing when you become famous.\" For my 9 year old, this comment has been so crucial to building him up... this comment made months ago, comes up time and time again.\n\n<em>I'm thankful for all of the \"reading stars\" who I \"am so glad are in my class\"...\u00a0</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>3. The little things we do matter too!</strong>\n\nMy kindergartner has asthma. Not just the kind that requires an inhaler after he's been running around, but the kind that can get scary and require hospital visits and stays. A few weeks ago it was his turn to be Star of the Week! This chance only comes around once in a kindergarten lifetime, so I let out a sad sigh when the Monday of his turn I received a call from his school nurse. He spent the rest of the week home, plagued by asthma attacks, fevers, and ear infections. His teacher e-mailed daily to check in on him. When he had missed a few days, she anticipated his sadness about missing all the special jobs that come with star of the week, so she e-mailed to reschedule his week. This sick kid peeled his whiny hiney off the couch to jump up and down with joy!\n\n<em>I wonder what little things I can do to make my students jump for joy!</em>\n\n<strong>4.School-home communication and involvement means a lot to parents!</strong>\n\nI have sent e-mails, made phone calls, and invited parents into my classroom on a regular basis throughout my teaching career. I enjoyed getting to know them and showing off all we had been doing and learning at school.\n\nI don't think I realized just how much of a difference it makes as a parent to get that e-mail with a silly story from the day, to be mystery reader for the class, or to sit in the audience of a Readers' theater performance in my child's classroom. Tomorrow, in fact, I have the opportunity (being on maternity leave) to go do a gallery walk of my fourth grade class' Hole in One projects, which were the culmination of their geometry unit (angles and all!).\n\n<em>I will seek opportunities to invite parents, not because my administration says so, but because it makes a difference.\u00a0</em>\n\n<strong>5. Saying thank you to the teacher does matter.</strong>\n\nThis one I learned as a teacher, and embrace as a mom. I look for opportunities to regularly thank my childrens' teachers. After all, they love my children, care for them, and TEACH them! \u00a0When my children are learning, feeling great about themselves, and being coached through the social landscape by a teacher who appreciates them, I am so thankful... and saying thank you makes a difference. As a teacher, receiving these words of appreciation make all the difference!\n\n<em>I will always show my appreciation for my children's teachers.</em>\n\n<strong>6. Parents are doing the best they can.\u00a0</strong>\n\nLet's be real.. the above list is just the beginning of what I've learned, but I'm sitting here typing with one hand as I hold my newborn and listen to my boys do their nightly reading. \u00a0My son went to school this morning with his hair sticking straight up in the back. My other son had his shirt on backwards (I noticed as he dashed off the bus). Sometimes they \"forget\" to brush their teeth in the morning. Sometimes we forget their mittens and hats on a cold day... and sometimes we even*gasp* forget to do/ run out of time for homework. Is it because school and education is not important to me? No. It's because being a mom is about more than all these things. In this life I love these little beings with all that I am. Sometimes that means snuggling up in my recliner chair with my 5 year old as he falls asleep early in my lap. Sometimes I make homemade pancakes and don't check that my fourth grader remembered his trumpet on B and D3 days (what is with these complicated schedules anyway??? ). So enough with the judgmental\u00a0teacher talk I sometimes hear...\n\n<em>I will give parents a break.\u00a0</em>",

But in order to survive pregnancy as a teacher, I had to let some things go (this post being one of them).</p>\n&nbsp;\n***This post contains affiliate links. We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n\n***\n\n1. <strong>Schedule bathroom breaks-</strong> If at all possible, reach out for help- ask someone, anyone, if they can pop into your room for 3 minutes each day at some point to give you a break fort he bathroom. And whether or not you feel like you have to go (at the end you will always, perpetually have to go) you go. I was so lucky that there are some paraprofessionals/ IAs that could come in to give me a quick break. I also had some push in support for my students, so my biggest \u00a0challenge was the long waddle down the hallway to go to the bathroom 5 times a day.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/writer3-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-909\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/writer3-1-300x219.png\" alt=\"writer3 1\" width=\"211\" height=\"154\" /></a></p>\n2. <strong>Make Lists-\u00a0</strong>After weeks and weeks of back and forth across my classroom, down the hallways to the copier I decided to get organized. This is especially important with the infamous \"pregnancy brain\". \u00a0How many times did I finish getting my math lessons copied and prepped, only to realize that I needed to head back to the copier to get materials for the next day's writing lesson? \u00a0I made three lists- Prep, Make, Copy. \u00a0That way I could multitask my visit to the copier with going to the book room as well. \u00a0It will definitely help save those swollen feet and sore hips!\n\n3. <strong>Establish routines that support independence</strong>- This is one of those things that is a good idea to do- pregnant or not. I kept in mind my growing bump before it got too big. We spent lots of time practicing transition routines and how to distribute papers. We practiced clean up \"over and under\" the tables. These little lessons proved so valuable when it was hard for me to get around. I didn't have to start nagging students to pick up the crayons under the tables because it had become routine.\n\n4.<strong>Get a yoga ball chair!</strong> I got one early in the year and it was my best friend! I got one with a back so I could stabilize myself. it also had wheels, so in those last painful weeks, I could wheel myself between the student tables.\n\nThis is the one I got and LOVED!\n<iframe style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ac&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=printableprom-20&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=B01DUYIOFU&asins=B01DUYIOFU&linkId=cee0d78ba0ce76cbf64f64314d4d5f55&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true&price_color=333333&title_color=0066c0&bg_color=ffffff\">\n    </iframe>\n(Affiliate link)\n\n5. <strong>Say YES to help! and NO to more work-</strong>This is a two part one- and this one was tough for me. I don't like to accept help, I typically just like to get things done. I learned quickly that its ok to accept help. Let your team member drop your kiddos off at special, or grab something from your mailbox when they offer.\n\nAbout the second part- you don't have to say no in a lazy, self pityijng way. Opportunities to take on new things- new committees, new initiatives- just seem to throw themselves at teachers. I was on a committee I loved, but knew that the amount of time I'd need to spend out of the classroom, and the timing of my maternity leave would not be ideal, so as difficult as it was, I bowed out. \u00a0It's ok to say you have enough on your plate!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Coffee-Cup_3.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-908 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Coffee-Cup_3-218x300.png\" alt=\"Coffee Cup_3\" width=\"109\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n6. <strong>Enjoy a little caffeine-</strong> I definitely enjoyed caffeine in the form of a morning and afternoon coffee (with the OK of my doctor of course). \u00a0It literally helped me to survive, especially in the afternoons when I was in a state of exhaustion I've never felt before.

In fact, I hadn't even wondered what one was because I had never heard of one at all, until I registered for my first one!\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170506_155602.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-912\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170506_155602-300x300.jpg\" nopin= \"nopin\" alt=\"IMG_20170506_155602\" width=\"274\" height=\"274\" /></a></p>\nMy awesome teacher friend Tara ( @myfirstgradezoo) invited me to the Spring TPT Unconference.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here's what I knew when I agreed to go:</p>\n1. I would get to hang out with my friend for the day\n\n2.We would spend the day in NYC\n\n3. I have been home on Maternity leave for three months and I could use a day away.\nWhat I learned while I was there was so much more than I could have ever imagined!\n\nFirst of all I learned that an unconference is an amazing thing! It's a participant driven gathering of people who come together to learn and share. There are no presenters, although there was a facilitator to get the conversations going and there are no slideshows.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here's What I loved about the unconference:</p>\n1. I got to ask questions and receive tips from highly successful (the MOST successful) TPT authors to get their input on future steps.\n\n2. I was able to share what is working for me to help other new-ish authors.\n\n3. Everyone was valued and respected.\n\n4. The TPT office in NYC is amazing and I need a Bevi machine in my life!\n\nIt was definitely a milestone for me. I feel like \"First TPT Unconference\" is worthy of baby book status (hah).\n\nI took away several awesome ideas and have some amazing next steps so stay tuned as we continue on this fabulous journey!\n\n&nbsp;",

Thank you for being the smiling teacher who is \"very pretty with golden hair.\" \u00a0Thank you for the \"good day sticker\" smack dab in the middle of his forehead every day, evidence of a day filled with laughter. Thank you for calling him \"handsome\" and lighting his face up! Thank you for holding his hand on the way to lunch. Thank you for making him feel like he is your favorite student ever... I'm pretty sure that all your students feel that way.\n\nThank you for taking care of him. Thank you for helping him overcome his fear of self flushing toilets. \u00a0Thank you for giving him a big hug when he was sad on the first day of school. \u00a0Thank you for letting him keep the box of tissues on his table when he had that never ending cold. Thank you for sending get well e-mails when he was home sick, and for the check in e-mails when he was at school. Thank you for switching his star week when he was sick ALL WEEK LONG and missed out on the fun. Thank you for walking him down to parent pick up\u00a0just to make sure he got there safely when he was cleaning up at his typical turtle pace and missed heading down with his friends.\n\nThank you for noticing. Thank you for noticing when it was a good time for him to check in with the nurse for his asthma. Thank you for noticing him standing with his hand up as everyone else was off playing because he \"doesn't know how to hula hoop\". \u00a0Thank \u00a0you for noticing his strengths. Thank you for noticing his new \"cool\" haircut. Thank you for noticing that he REALLY wanted his lunch in his \"forgotten at school\" lunchbox the day he brought his spare... and for taking the time to help him switch his lunch over.\n\nThank you for sharing with him. Thank you for sharing your lunchtimes with him. Thank you for sharing your mom and dad, the famous Mr. &amp; Mrs. K. Thank you for sharing your recess time on field day playing blocks with him, rather than taking the break you deserved so very much. \u00a0Thank you for sharing Sawyer stories with him, and thus our entire family (even if it took \u00a0my husband months to figure out Sawyer is a cat... and NOT a student in your class). \u00a0 Thank you for sharing your very yummy extra snack with him... Thank you for later finding his goldfish crackers under his jacket... and thank you for letting it go. Thank you for sharing your love and joy of learning with him. Thank you for sharing your Saturday with him and his classmates\u00a0at his friend's birthday picnic, where you even let them throw the water balloons at you!\n\nThank you for celebrating him. \u00a0Thank you for the \"love notes\" celebrating his helpful, kind, and hard working moments. \u00a0Thank you for acknowledging him as \u00a0a \"kindergarten role model\", a job he takes VERY seriously! \u00a0Thank you for cheering him on as he ran around the field when he crashed your running club on Wednesday afternoons. \u00a0Thank you for running with him. Thank you for running to him, without hesitation, \u00a0when he fell down. \u00a0Thank you for celebrating the birth of his little sister with as much joy as he had. Thank you for celebrating as he \"earned\" each one of his reading super powers. Thank you for celebrating by getting \"teary eyed\" as he made big accomplishments.\n\nThank you for supporting us. Thank you for checking and answering my e-mails 10 minutes before school starts. Thank you for \"keeping an eye on him\" when we welcomed our new baby, and when his dad went out of town. Thank you for inviting me in to share as a mystery reader, and during centers. \u00a0Thank you for making the worry disappear because I knew he was loved and cared for.\n\nThank you for being the kind of teacher who gives us so many wonderful things to remember.\n\nWe all love you Miss K!\n\nThank you.",

Color coding sight words to make them seasonally relevant and help struggling readers! \" width=\"620\" height=\"620\" /></a>As a first grade teacher, I have recognized that one of the biggest indicators of my students' reading success is their sight word knowledge. This is especially important for my struggling kiddos because they are spending so much time and \"thinking space\" in their brains working to decode all the other words.</p>\nThese struggling readers are also the ones who used to never ever use my word wall because it was full of a sea of words that all looked the same, few of which they could read without becoming frustrated.\n\nIn addition, I had this huge list of first grade words for the kiddos to learn, and I had to try to keep myself on track. A few summers ago I decided, mostly to keep myself on schedule, to write the sight words I wanted to focus on each month on a seasonal shape. This way I would know I had to get through the red apple words in September, and so on.\n\nThe result was much more interesting than keeping me on track.\n\n<strong>Three awesome things that happened:</strong>\n\n1. The students LOVED seeing what color and shape/image was coming in the month ahead.\n\n2.The words were broken \u00a0up into smaller groups. Instead of a SEA of sight words, there were red apple words, and orange pumpkin words. Students were much less overwhelmed.\n\n3. Students were able to locate them much more easily on the word wall. It was as if they had made more connections in their minds with a color and shape/image being associated with the words.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/First-Grade-Sight-Word-Cards-color-coded-3232901\">Get the cards for free here!</a>\n\nSO.. I continued my work over the next two years and developed some seasonal \"word work\" center activities to go along with words!\n\nAnd now I'm (almost) ready to share them all with you!\n\nI have JUST posted my September first grade sight word resource along with color by code, word strip puzzles, a roll and highlight game, and directions for a traditional match game.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/September-Sight-Words-3216613\" target=\"_blank\">Check it out here!</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/September-Sight-Words-3216613\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-930 \" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sight-words-all-year-september-cover-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Sight Words all Year!

I have found that there are 4 important ingredients to creating sight word activities to keep my students begging for more!\" width=\"1601\" height=\"1201\" /></a>\n\n<strong>My Sight Word Practice Activities have four important \"ingredients\":</strong>\n<strong>1.</strong> They require repeated practice reading the words.\n\n<strong>2.</strong> They are varied in type of activity and materials used.\n\n<strong>3.</strong> They can be done mostly independently (or with a partner) and can be repeated.\n\n<strong>4.</strong> They are fun and engaging! They are more than just \"worksheets\".\n\nI tend to use different activities month to month, but the color by word activities I use different images all year long (they can't get enough of these!). I also like to repeat the activities after a month or two with new words, or even with a slight spin on the activities as the year goes on. This leads to increased independence and confidence!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Sight-Words-All-Year-Growing-Bundle-3216623\">I'm ready to share the September practice with you Here!</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

So Good.</strong></p>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6qNDNMiR2QiRm9nbzE5TGgwY0E/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-945 size-large\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beach-day-video-image-1024x557.jpg\" alt=\"The beach is good for our students and kids! \" width=\"620\" height=\"337\" /></a>\n\nKids learn so much at the beach... but this post won't be about identifying sea creatures or collecting and graphic seashells... although those would be fun beachy follow ups (maybe for a later post ;-) )\n\nThis post is about all the things kids learn at the beach all on their own.\n\nAs I watched my son spin in circles carefree I realized that what he was doing was good. It was good for his soul. It was just so good. He was learning, among other things, to<strong> just be.</strong>\n\nAs I continued to watch and think, here are some things that I noticed kids around me learning and practicing.\n\n<strong>1. How to\u00a0notice. </strong>They notice things all around them. They notice the sights and the sounds. They notice these things all on their own. Sometimes they verbalize them, sometimes not. There's something special about undirected noticing and observing.\n\n<strong>2.How to create.\u00a0</strong>Suddenly here they are in a sea of sand (and sea for that matter). What will they do? They'll create. They'll dig holes, imagine, build structures, knock those structures down and rebuild something new in it's place.\n\n<strong>3.How to cooperate.\u00a0</strong>As my kids were playing they were approached by several other children asking if they could join in. \u00a0Why is it in my classroom my students are always looking for an invitation (and feeling left out if they are not invited)... but here on the beach, they approach without a care. They join in and suddenly you have new friends to notice and create with.\n\n<strong>4.How to feel.</strong>\u00a0I feel like in life I (and thus my kids) are usually going 100 mph. Yes we take quiet moments together, but do we take moments to just feel? The beach encourages this so much. I watched my children take deep breaths, put their faces towards the sun, sit in the ocean and wait for the waves to crash over them. They were just feeling in this world<strong>.</strong>\n\n<strong>5. How to just be.\u00a0</strong>There is no \"I'm bored\" at the beach. Just being there is enough. Kids need to practice just existing in our world, free of all the structure of a typical life and classroom environment. Everything SLOOWWWSSS Down.\n\n<strong>How can these lessons help us in the classroom?\u00a0</strong>\nWhen we have students who notice, we have students who wonder. When students practice noticing and creating on their own, in their world, they are more used to these routines. They work cooperatively and flexibly. \u00a0When we give children opportunities to do these things at the beach, and elsewhere, we are encouraging learner behaviors that are good for the soul as well as building a huge set of background knowledge. Aren't we always hearing how background knowledge is so important? And background knowledge isn't just about knowing facts, or reading books. It's about experiencing the world.\n\nWith that being said... we're off to the beach :-)\n\nHappy Summer!",

    "title": "Steps for Setting Classroom Rules",
    "content": "Each year we have the new adventure of building a classroom community of learners who are collaborative and creative.\n\nWhile sometimes thinking about rules seems like a snooze, students really appreciate the boundaries and are especially invested if they are part of the discussion surrounding creating the rules and expectations (even if you already know what the gist of the rules will be).\n\nWalking in on the first day of school,\u00a0 my students never heard me rattle off a list of rules for their behavior. Instead I started with just one statement that I was able to use to manage behavior while we took the time to set the rules with a positive and collaborative tone.\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Step 1: start with one overarching expectation</span></strong></h1>\nThe message I always chose was \"Your job is to be the best ___ grader you can be. My job is to help you be the best you can be.\" After sending this message, all kinds of other things can kind of fall under this category. Throwing blocks at Jerome? \"Remember in ___ grade it's our job to be the very best ___ grader we can.\" The other thing I like about this message is that it also sets the tone that they have ownership for their learning success and their behavior.\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Step 2: Notice and Note Positive Behaviors</span></strong></h1>\nThe <strong>second</strong> task is\u00a0to have a chart ready that says \"How to be the <strong>best</strong> I can be\".\n\nAs the day goes on I \"notice\" things the students are doing.\n\nFor example: \u00a0\"I see that Suzie is looking right at me, ready to listen for directions. Do you think this is helping her to be the best she can be?\"\n\nor\n\n\"I heard Johnny give Suzie a compliment! Do you think that is helping him be the best he can be?\"\n\nI really really focus on the positive behaviors during the early stages. As these situations come up, I add them to the list!\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Step 3: Set Class Rules</strong></span></h1>\n<strong>After a few days,</strong> we are ready to set class rules together.\n\nI always have my back pocket list of \"I need these rules to be an effective teacher.\" They look something like this.\n\n<strong>*We will\u00a0be respectful</strong>\n\n<strong>*We will be safe</strong>\n\n<strong>*We will be kind</strong>\n\n<strong>*We do our best</strong>\n\nI like to begin the discussion with the language we've been using. For example \"How have we noticed members of our class being the best they could be?\" We look back at our list developed over the past few days and then add to it as needed. With some coaching we start to notice which things are so important they should be rules. Then, in the student language We develop a list of (generally) four rules, but sometimes 5 :-)\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Step 4. Practice The Rules</strong></span></h1>\nOnce the rules are set, I display them in the room and we start practicing those rules through modeled behavior.\u00a0 For some of the activities and lessons (simple lessons) we ONLY practice the rules... practicing the rules is the objective! I have used emergent readers, sorting activities, posters, personal teaching demonstrations of examples and non examples of following the rules and expectations (they love when I crawl around with a book on my head).\n\nSometimes my kiddos need a little more practice, \u00a0or even just more <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/School-Rules-Bundle-Classroom-Management-3992694\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">direct practice.</a>\n\nHere is a bundle of my \"school rules\" resources. They include emergent readers, sorting, and extension activities.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/School-Rules-Bundle-Classroom-Management-3992694\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1924\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/original-3992694-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're looking for more fun back to school resources, <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/back-to-school-teaching-resources-for-elementary-school/\">check these favorites out!</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

Sometimes it's to celebrate the first day, a birthday, a special accomplishment, and even the end of the school year!\n\nMy own kids have also loved giving their friends a little something at the end of the year, so here are three quick and easy ideas for class gifts!\n\nHere are three Quick, Easy, and Inexpensive gifts for your little learners!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1151 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Bubbles-300x300.png\" nopin=\"nopin\" alt=\"Fun back to school, birthday, holiday, or end of the year gifts for your class! \" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />\n\nI picked up 8 packs of bubbles ( I think I paid $2.97 for each 8 pack). \u00a0I typed up this little cute poem to give it a personal touch! I gave these to students on the last day when we also celebrated bubble day (Click here for my Bubble Fun Resource).\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1152 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pencils-300x300.png\" nopin= \"nopin\" alt=\"Fun back to school, birthday, holiday, or end of the year gifts for your class! \" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />\n\nMake a pencil a snazzy little gift by picking up some fun prints (Do yourself a favor and skip the ones with the thick plastic design) and adding a little flag! These were gifts from my son to his class, but the whole pack of 24 pencils was $2.97! \u00a0You could definitely modify your little flags to say \" I hope your birthday is on point\" or \"I hope your school year is on point\" or even \"I hope your New Year is on point!\"\n\nIf you want to add a little more, you could put them in a little baggie and add a cool eraser and a manual pencil sharpener.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1153 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/CHALK-300x300.png\" nopin=\"nopin\" alt=\"Fun back to school, birthday, holiday, or end of the year gifts for your class! \" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />\n\nI love this chalk gift! Again I got a 36 pack of chalk for $2.97 (+ $1 for baggies) which was perfect for my son's class and my past students. I've used this idea for years and students love them! Once again you can use this any time of year just fill in the blank! \"I Hope _______ is Chalk Full Of Fun!\"\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<div style=\"display: none;\"> <img src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-Quick-EasyGifts-for-your-Class-2-683x1024.png\" alt=\"3 Quick and easy class gifts!\" width=\"620\" height=\"930\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1160\" /><a data-pin-do=\"buttonBookmark\" data-pin-save=\"true\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/\"></a>",

Send home a warm and inviting summer introduction letter!</span></h1>\nI have posted more about this in a <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/5-steps-to-writing-a-perfect-summer-letter/\">separate post</a>, but sending home an engaging summer letter that gets their child excited about the adventures of the new school year is so crucial! This will help them to feel connected to you before they send their little one off on the first day!\n<h1><span style=\"color: #993366;\">2.Send home an \"On Our First Day!\" letter.</span></h1>\nThis is something I just started doing this past year and parents commented throughout the year about how much they appreciated it! I did not differentiate this for each student, but instead made it ahead of time! I took a picture of our classroom \u00a0and one of our \u00a0bulletin boards! You could also include a photo of the welcome bulletin board (if you don't have time to insert one with student work), \u00a0your morning message, or photos of books you'll read the first day.\n\nHere's a sample of what my one page letter looked like:<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1232\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dayonenews-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"451\" height=\"601\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1><span style=\"color: #993366;\">3.Call every parent the first week!</span></h1>\nI know this sounds like a big feat because the back to school season is buzzing with activities and todo lists!... But being a parent myself, I know how much it means to me to know my child is valued and worth a quick call! After all, they send their little treasured loved ones to us each day!\n\nHere's a quick and generic \"First Home Communication\" Sheet I use.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1233\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/first-communication-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"599\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1><span style=\"color: #993366;\">4.Set up a communication routine.</span></h1>\nI like to collect parent preferred contact information early on in the year. At latest I collect this information at back to school night/ open house, but I often send home a basic information collection page the first day!\nA new discovery of mine has been a service called <a href=\"https://www.remind.com/\">Remind!</a> I set up a class, have parents sign up and join, and then I can quickly and easily communicate with them throughout the school year! (I'll write more about this soon!)\n<h1><span style=\"color: #993366;\">5. communicate monthly... with pictures!</span></h1>\nThe communication parents seem to appreciate more than ever are the monthly newsletters I put together and send home full of pictures of the learning activities and projects we've done throughout the month. This is such a positive peek into our classroom for parents and has been well worth the time investment! (I'll write more about this later too!)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTaking these 5 steps can really help to keep parents in the loop, and will make for much stronger partnerships right from the beginning of the year! We all know that stronger partnerships make for a much smoother and enriched school year!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1212\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ee1192e98e0e2825b5264db45b7d7b58.jpg\" alt=\"Write the Perfect Summer Letter in just 5 steps!\" width=\"294\" height=\"440\" />\n\nI LOVE writing summer introduction letters to my students! At first I was so overwhelmed by all of the possibilities. I wondered... Should my letter be addressed to the student, the parents, both? Should I spend time writing about my background as a teacher? Should I include anything about my family?\n\nNow more than ever there are questions like:\u00a0 Should I send the letter digitally, or in the mail (in my experience kids REALLY REALLY love getting mail).\n\nOne thing is for certain building those school-home relationships is invaluable and you'll want and need families as your partners in best serving their children!\u00a0The truth is, regardless of how you're teaching (in person, online, both) your students and families can't wait to \"meet you!\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter writing these a few years in a row here's what I learned worked best:\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Oswald, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;\">1.Address the letter to your students- By name!</span>\n\nI used to this in Open Office Presentation (comparable to Powerpoint), but now I also use Google Slides which is nice to use especially if you are using Google Classroom and you plan to share your letter digitally.\n\nI create the page just how I like it, then I duplicate the page and just change the student name on each page.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Oswald, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;\">2.Write a little bit about you</span>\n\nI usually include two- three sentences and that's it! I write to tell what I like to do, how many children I have, and of course, my pet. They LOVE to hear about pets! I don't include a resume like list of my accomplishments and past experiences\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Oswald, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;\">3.Write to excite them</span>\n\nShare a few fun things that they will do in first grade! I like to share \"You will become an author as you learn to write and illustrate your very own stories\" for example. They don't need a curriculum outline.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Oswald, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;\">4.Give them 3 (ish) small details about the first day</span>\n\nI include \u00a0Where and When to come to school- what to bring- and a little teaser about something fun that will happen on the first day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Oswald, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;\">5.Sign it with your name </span><strong style=\"font-family: Oswald, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;\">AND</strong><span style=\"font-family: Oswald, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;\"> A PICTURE!</span>\n\nThis is by far, in my opinion, the most important part of the letter. I have heard from countless students and parents how much they appreciated seeing my face before the school year so they knew what to expect!\n\nHere's a sample of a letter:\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfBcpXe7tVra6dldlvmEgS5nOWpcCmOGA8CFg2SMHOtGLONw/viewform?usp=sf_link\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2256\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Summer-Letter-Template.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"382\" height=\"495\" /></a>\n\nI have never sent home a letter directly to parents, but if you felt the need to, I would address it to \"first grade family\" and do it as a separate page. This might be especially helpful if you find that there will be a lot of changes in your school environment in the coming year.\n\nNot only will this letter help your students seem reassured, it shows how much you care about their child already by writing a personal and welcoming message! They'll need this especially when times seem uncertain!\n\nThis year I've revamped my template to be a little more friendly and I'm ready to share that with you too!\n\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/summer2020letter\"><strong>If you'd like a free copy of the template and samples I've created for Google Slides, check it out here!</strong> </a>\n\nIf you wouldn't mind taking a couple minutes to answer the 5 questions as well, that would really help me out!\n\n(This post was updated July 14, 2020)",

Hear the top tips Veteran teachers share to make your transition back to school Sweet! Back to School | Back to school advice| New School Year | \" width=\"620\" height=\"930\" />\n\nOn a recent LONG (15 hour) car ride home, I was rocking out to Justin Bieber (don't judge) and I got to thinking, mostly as a way of entertaining myself... \"If I had to share just one little back to school tip that would make a big difference, what would it be?\"\n\nWould it be a big piece of feel good advice, or a small simple change that would make a big difference in the ease of heading back? It helped me pass quite a bit of time as I tossed ideas around in my head and finally picked the one piece of advice I'd offer. Here it is... simple and sweet...\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Keep M&amp;Ms in your desk at all times!</span></strong></h1>\n<strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\"> (if you're like me...the peanut butter kind). \u00a0There's not always a lot of time to eat, but a hungry teacher=a cranky teacher. \u00a0If M&amp;Ms aren't your jam, then any quick and easy snack will do. And for my coffee drinkers, keep a small Keurig machine in your room. \u00a0I am much happier when I'm caffeinated.</span></strong></blockquote>\nOk, so that's kind of two pieces of advice... but really good and easy advice, and you're better for knowing it...right?<em> Don't you feel more prepared already?</em>\n\nThen I got to thinking.... what would other experienced teachers say as they responded to this same question?\n\nI am a part of some awesome teacher social media groups and it is AMAZING to hear what other teachers are doing out there! \u00a0So I asked this group of Teachers (who are all teacher mamas) and here is what they shared as their one best back to school tip!\n<blockquote><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Print \u00a0several sheets of labels with your student names on them. \u00a0This makes labeling pencil boxes, folders, and notebooks a breeze!</span> </span></strong>\n\n<strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Tara-Hardink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">-Tara </a><a href=\"http://myfirstgradezoo.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(My First Grade Zoo)</a></span></strong></blockquote>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">____________________</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800080;\">When decorating use black buckets, tubs or bins.

Find out why!\" width=\"620\" height=\"930\" />With all these back to school posts starting to surface, I quickly feel like climbing back into my shell. Even though I am taking a one year maternity leave, my classroom has never had beautiful bunting borders,\u00a0fancy hanging lights, or even pretty labels on every bin.\n\nSo as the turtle in me begins to retreat... the hardworking teacher in me is screaming\"Hey, my classroom is just fine! Share it with the world! \"\n\nSo I'm going with this new philosophy... my classroom is Pinterest worthy and so is YOURS!\n\nHow? Do I need to run out and spend hundreds of dollars on cute little matching themed baskets and buckets, beautiful light boxes, and DIY upholstered stools? Nope.\n\nIn fact, ALL classrooms are pinterest worthy! Pinterest is a place for us to share what we do, and how we rock different parts of our lives. That means that you... yes YOU should be able to feel great about posting a picture of your awesome classroom.\n\nIn fact, I prefer a more clean cut (although not apparent from this picture which was taken mid- set up) approach. I have bright bulletin boards and open spaces, but things are pretty simple. And my classroom is not any better or any worse than the teacher down the hall. All classrooms simple or fancy are worthy of sharing!\n\nAnd let's be completely honest... it's what you do inside those 4 walls on a day to day basis that DEFINITELY makes your classroom even MORE pinterest worthy! I'm sure your classroom is bursting with ideas and wonderful work that teachers everywhere could benefit from!\n\nSo don't be shy! Come out of your shell! Share the ideas you have each day... \u00a0share your simple, but awesome bulletin board with student work that they are so proud of... and sure, share the one you spent a whole weeks worth of plan periods putting up. Share the word work center you threw together in 5 minutes.... and share the one you spent your whole weekend (and budget) prepping.\n\nRemember this back to school season that what you do is worth sharing!\n\nIf for no other reason than to help out a fellow turtle teacher :-)",

Wondering how to quiet down the chatter? Ask yourself three questions about your talkative class before planning your next classroom management steps. Number 2 might surprise you!\" width=\"468\" height=\"702\" /></a>\n\nAre you sick of \"shhhhh\"ing your class?\n\nI'm going to go ahead and get started by just saying, I am not afraid of a noisy class. In fact, I am one of those teachers who sometimes keeps the door shut just to keep the productive chitter chatter of busy first graders in, so as not to disturb the other quiet learners. Chatter can also be quite productive, collaborative and developmentally appropriate... So here is a big slice of reassurance for you - <strong> Your classroom does not have to be silent. </strong> Breathe a sigh of relief. You are not a bad teacher, or less effective teacher if you have an extra chatty bunch this year!\nI get it though... chitter chatter is not always a productive happening and can interfere with learning... or interfere with your sanity!\nHere are three questions I like to ask myself before reacting when I notice my students are extra chatty.\n<h1>1. What is the pattern of chatter?</h1>\nThe first thing I need to assess is when the problem is happening and then why it might be happening. Is this a \"sometimes\" chatter, an \"at certain times of the day\" chatter, or an \"aalllll dayyyyy looonnnggg \" chatter?\n\nFor the past few years, for example, My students have had lunch, recess, and special back to back right smack dab in the middle of the day. The time of high chatter was right after they returned to the room from special. \u00a0Noticing this pattern helped me to realize that really, their schedule was the cause of their excessive talking .\n<h1>2. Is the chatter a problem?... How big of a problem?</h1>\nOk, you caught me... this is really two questions. They really are asking the same thing, but I insert the first part because when I really think about it, there's no reason to be worried about the kiddos talking during certain times of the day. At the end of the day, for example, I find it unnecessary for them to be silent, \u00a0until dismissal is called (so talking during dismissal announcements would be a BIG problem).\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">During reading and math times, my students are at centers for MOST of the time. I don't mind if they talk during these times.</p>\n<strong> This means that most of the time as long as the chatter is not interfering with the order of the classroom I leave it alone. That's right. I shrug my shoulders. Note that it's a chatty but productive time and let it go. </strong>\n\nIt was a problem for me when they were coming in with super high energy and talking up a storm after the lunch, recess, special predicament because we still had two hours of learning left, including ALL of their math instruction. This problem was going to need addressing.\n<h1>3. What can I do about it?</h1>\nNow, you may or may not have noticed, but saying (or yelling) \"quiet class!\" isn't always very effective... at least for long... with young learners. \u00a0They don't like it, and I don't like myself much for that matter, when I find myself nagging and nagging them about something (including the volume). For the most part, they can't help themselves; they are so busy and bursting with excitement and things to share.\n\nIf I have decided in the above circumstance that the chatter IS a problem, here are some things I do to address it.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/establishing-quiet-classroom-routines/\">*establish AND PRACTICE quiet(er) routines- (Click to read more!)</a>\n\n*establish a signal (visual and auditory)- a wind chime, a little chant, or a bell ring are all examples I've used before.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/establishing-quiet-classroom-routines/\">*explicitly teach about AND PRACTICE voice levels (Click to read more!)</a>\n\nAnd remember all routines take time! Don't get discouraged! You're a great teacher and your students are great too!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere's a link to some of my favorite activities for teaching voice levels explicitly!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Voice-Levels-Lessons-Chart-and-Practice-Activities-3879903\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1602\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Visual-voice.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"173\" height=\"173\" /></a>",

        "content": "Professionally I think my teaching style has always been one that was less about controlling a sound environment and more about teaching students to manage themselves well, making the most of their time and energy in the classroom.  Sometimes this meant they were monitoring their time on their own within well-defined boundaries.  If there was chatter that was still productive and not a distraction to others, I didn't consider it a conflict to them completing their tasks.  When I was in the middle of teaching, however, I did expect respect in the moment, and part of respect was a listening attitude.  \n\nI notice you mention \"Establishing Routines\" here and that is SO important!  Letting kids understand what the individual teacher's expectations are in each classroom is key to finding success in each classroom.  Thanks for the post and your encouragement to new teachers!",

    "content": "<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1330\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6-Ways-1-1-683x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"485\" height=\"728\" />\n\nIf you've been following me along here, you already know that I am not a \"quiet class\" teacher. I am a noisy, busy, bursting with excitement teacher. I like to call it.... productive chaotic sounding learning (Is that even a thing? I may have just invented something there).\n\nBut if you have an extra talkative class and you've asked and answered three important questions <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/3-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-you-have-a-noisy-class/\">(click here to read more)</a>, then here are some routines and tips for helping encourage calmness and quiet.\n\nBefore we get started I just want to mention that NONE of these are magic cures... if you find one, comment below. Each of these ideas, routines, expectations, will need to be taught explicitly, practiced promptly, and reinforced regularly. (see more about teaching classroom rules)\n\nHere are some things I've tried in my classroom to encourage quiet:\n<h1>1.Visual voice chart</h1>\nStudents can see that you've established the voice level appropriate for the current activity. Students can even have their own small version with a clothespin if you find that particular students benefit from more direct reinforcement.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1324 \" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/visual-voice-chartblog-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Visual voice volume charts are a great way to set clear expectations for the volume in the classroom! Check out 5 other ways to establish quiet(er) classroom routines!\" width=\"332\" height=\"442\" />\n\n<em>(This chart is available as a part of my <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Voice-Levels-Lessons-Chart-and-Practice-Activities-3879903\">voice levels</a> resource)</em>\n<h1>2.Quiet music</h1>\nQuiet music helps me to feel so calm and I fill like it just fills my patience jar right up! It seems to do the same for my students. When I discussed before about my students struggling to refocus for the afternoon, this was the first thing I tried, quiet music was already playing when they reentered the classroom for the afternoon. I also turned on quiet music during independent work time, when students were expected to have whisper voices. This helped tremendously. After teaching and practicing this, students would automatically quiet to a whisper when the music was on. ALSO, if the chatter becomes too loud I could ask \"Is anyone else having trouble hearing the music?\" (We have a routine to raise their pointer finger when I ask this type of question). This feels so much better than \"Booyyysss and Girrlllss you're tooo noisssyy\"( Haven't you always dreamed of being <em>that</em> teacher with the voice that drones on?).\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1325\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Quiet-Music-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" />\n<h1>3.Take a \u00a0QT (quiet time)</h1>\nI call this \"QT\" in my room just because it is a lot more fun to say than \"quiet time\", but to each their own. I implemented this along with the quiet music, and dimmed lights. Students knew that after special we have a 5 minute \"QT\" ( I even make the time out signal like I'm some star quarter back or something). It takes time... but I consider it a time investment. It takes a lot less time than shushing and nagging \u00a0them all afternoon!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1326\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QT-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Oswald, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;\">4.Change your schedule (GASP!)\n</span>\n\nI know, this is a hard pill to swallow- just wait for #5. Sometimes your schedule just isn't going to work. You can't always change the lunch or recess or special schedule, but can you change little parts of your classroom schedule? Maybe a snack is in order during that chatty time. Maybe some classroom yoga, or a QT is in order. Maybe teaching math in the morning would work better for your students... give it a try!<span style=\"font-family: Oswald, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;\">\n</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1327\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2015-2016KT-schedule1-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><span style=\"font-family: Oswald, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;\">5.Change the way you teach (Bigger GASP!)</span>\n\nDeep inside you might have this thought floating around \"If they just listened and followed directions this wouldn't be a problem\"... but the fact of the matter is that it IS a problem... and there may be something you can do about it! \u00a0My response to the chitter chatter dilemma (and the fact that I had such a wide range of academic levels in my class) prompted me to teach almost all day in a small group setting. Guided math and literacy centers every day. I limited my whole group lessons to 5 minutes at a time at the beginning of the year and slowly increased it (for my firsties) to 10-15 minutes. Let's be honest after 15 minutes I'm sick of hearing myself talk anyway. \u00a0Teaching in small groups had other benefits too including increased opportunities for differentiation, \u00a0increased student engagement and more (More about this later!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1328\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/center-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" />\n<h1>6.Give them something to talk about!</h1>\nWhen all else fails, schedule a group, partner, or table job for them to do together during these chatty times. If you can't reign it in, take advantage of it!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1329\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/talk-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" />\n\nI am so thankful I am not met by a dry and uniform group of robots each day. Every day I go into my classroom I am SO thankful to be greeted by a diverse enthusiastic group of individual little six and seven year olds (don't tell them I called them \"little\"). Sometimes they're a little chatty, but as I've said before, remember that it's just because they have SO much to share with us, their peers, and this world.",

Are parents reporting morning tears? Sometimes hesitant learners have a hard time transitioning into their school day or even experience some separation anxiety! Meet Gus and Henry, 2 of the fun ways to get students started in the morning. Read more about these 6 ways to help students get their day started with a smile!\" width=\"620\" height=\"930\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHave you ever had a student (or few) who you hear cry in the morning before school? They don't want to leave home. They take extra long to make their way down the hallway to your classroom, sometimes hesitantly enter with tears, and sometimes stand outside, not wanting to enter at all?\n\nThis has happened to me and I've felt TERRIBLE! I wonder what I'm doing wrong... have I done something to cause this anxiety?\n\nThe answer is usually no. It's a part of who some kiddos are and the reason for this behavior is multifaceted. Whether it's a case of separation anxiety, or something else, here they are... our little cherubs to nurture and teach!\n\nThe very first thing I always do is start the day right by <strong>standing at the door every single day to greet each of my students.</strong> This is such a great way to make sure that you're making contact with each student before they even enter your classroom! They can show you that gap in their smile where their tooth was just yesterday, show you a glimpse of those new shoes, or just say \"good morning!\" \u00a0When they know they are not alone entering a sea of students (especially if they are first, or last to arrive) it can help students to feel welcome and like they belong.\n\nSometimes students need something a little extra, or a lot extra!\n\nHere are some other fun little ways to get kids excited to enter the room! Please forgive me for the funny little names I use with some of them, I just find that as soon as I create a character for students to symbolize a routine it makes a huge difference! (If you love these little signs, I'm offering it as a freebie <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6yB_2tnJk3YVY2RDBZRHhrRTg/view?usp=sharing\">here</a>!)\n<h1><strong>1. a special job!\u00a0</strong></h1>\nI have found that just having classroom jobs at all helps out with this.. after all, no one wants to miss lineleader day, or being teacher's helper! \u00a0Think of a little something (it can be SO little) that this student can help you with each morning, like getting you a marker (their choice of color) to take lunch count with, or making a tally chart of friends as they enter the classroom.\n<h1><strong>2. good morning gus</strong></h1>\nSometimes a little extra something in the morning can also help! We count straws as a part of our morning meeting and then we bundle them and talk lots about place value, but I have also used a \"Morning Marble\" jar, where a student just goes over to a table (or even my desk) and places a marble each morning in a jar to show how many lovely day's we've had together. I've also spruced this up a little to have \"Good Morning Gus\" Instead of marbles, \u00a0he/she can add a pom pom to a cup with a face drawn on (intro Gus) upon entering the room. Something like this can distract the student from their anxious hesitance and can also help him/her to feel important.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1310\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-5-300x300.png\" nopin= \"nopin\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />\n<h1><strong>3. Give it 5</strong></h1>\nI have also used this technique. I love that all students can benefit from and use it without it becoming a big distraction.\n\nI hang a little poster with a picture of a handprint on it on the wall. The kiddos can give it a gentle high 5 when they enter the room. I have a number of copies with different sayings on them that the students can read or say as they high five into their day.\n\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz6yB_2tnJk3YVY2RDBZRHhrRTg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1267\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/morning-routines-for-hesitant-learners1-768x1024.jpg\" nopin= \"nopin\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"356\" /></a>\n<h1><strong>4.low pressure morning work\u00a0</strong></h1>\nThis one has been such a game changer for me. I used to put out a morning worksheet. What I found was it was too easy for many kids and many it was too hard for... so I spent time clarifying directions or helping students instead of greeting at the door. Can you imagine how it must feel for struggling students to come into the room and start their day with a task that is too hard for them... the school day is hard enough, and often times these morning work activities don't pay us back in value for what they cost in the way we start our day.\n\nInstead, I have started having students do a high success, low pressure morning work job as we wait for everyone to arrive. 2-3 days a week they read with a buddy (there is no \"I pick you\" first two to enter read together, next two, so on). When I greet them I even say \"_____ looks ready to read with you!\" Because we've spent time focusing on how to enjoy books, and they all have books they can read (even if it's picture reading) in their book boxes, this is fun and a high success time for them! Other times they can use playdough or pattern blocks. Sometimes there is a certain challenge or task (\"How many different creations can you make using the same 10 blocks\") and other times it's just exploration time with the materials.\n\nIn order to manage students knowing what to do, I print a \"Morning Work\" page and display it on the board. I like to put it in a dry erase pocket. Then I can write their morning job, or print little cards to stick/magnetize to it so they quickly know what to do when they enter.\n\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz6yB_2tnJk3YVY2RDBZRHhrRTg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1266\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/morning-routines-for-hesitant-learners2-768x1024.jpg\" nopin= \"nopin\" alt=\"\" width=\"316\" height=\"421\" /></a>\n<h1><strong>5. give them a mascot</strong></h1>\nSome teachers shy away from this, I don't always jump right to this one either, but if there is a student who seems to really have difficulty, sometimes I'll have them carry a little mascot back and forth to school. A little beanie or finger puppet or something can make a huge difference. It can help them to share about their day at school when they get home, and it's also a way to have them connect home with school.\n<h1><strong>6.hold it henry (or henrietta)</strong></h1>\nI use this in combination with the mascot, or instead of a mascot. Sometimes kids have a small special thing from home that helps them transition into their day. I have had students bring a small token from home that helps them to transition into the day. It could be a distraction, but Hold It Henry helps us out with that problem! I take one of those $1 bins and tape a label on it that says \"Hold It Henry\". They put the item in the bin when they enter the room, and take it with them at the end of the day! This works for lots of things (including trading cards and trinkets found in their pockets). I just signal them to place the belonging with \"Hold It Henry\" instead of taking it away from them.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1311\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-4-300x300.png\" nopin= \"nopin\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI've decided to put together these labels and signs for you for FREE <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6yB_2tnJk3YVY2RDBZRHhrRTg/view?usp=sharing\">here!\u00a0</a>\n\nDo you have any other fun ways to help your hesitant students enter the room?",

Is Bobby going to wipe a booger on Sal during my lesson again?\n\nTeacher evaluations are on the rise and one of the ways administrators are evaluating teachers is informal observations (formerly known as walk throughs, pop ins, etc). My principal can walk in unannounced, sit down, record the lesson, and then give me a score during a quick follow up afterwards.\n\nIn many ways this type of observation is much more difficult than the formal, hand in your lesson plan, type of scheduled lesson observations.\nBut fear not.\n\nHere are some tips to help you to Keep calm during informal observations!\n<h1>1. Be sure the principal has an up to date copy of your schedule.</h1>\nYou (probably) don't want your principal coming in to evaluate you during snack time and they probably don't want to either! Being sure your principal knows when these transitions will be occurring, this way he/she may be more likely to come in during instructional time. This is a really easy way to make for a better observation experience.\n<h1>2.Prepare your students for visitors.</h1>\nI tell my students from the beginning of the year that lots of people in our school and families are VERY excited about all the wonderful things first graders are doing. They may want to come in and see the wonderful things happening in first grade. I tell that we welcome visitors and then their job is to be the best first graders they can be so we can show what we know! This takes the pressure off of you, and helps the students take responsibility for their own behavior. Having and practicing a routine for visitors is exciting for students and amazing. You can have them greet the visitor with a simple \"Good Morning!\" or \"Good Afternoon\" or have something like a little jingle/ song. Ask your colleagues to pop in to practice how you can greet the visitor and then re engage in the lesson! It also helps to get right back into the routines. (Nice segue into tip #3)\n<h1>3.Establish classroom routines early.</h1>\nEstablishing classroom routines is an amazing investment of time for many many reasons. One small reason is that it will help you to engage and re engage your students when the principal, or any other visitor, comes into the classroom! Having a chime, signal, or quiet routine is amazing! Also, in my experience, transitions are one of the most pointed out times when hearing feedback from a principal. Investing in these transition routines will help you to have a much smoother year, and have a positive observation!\n<h1>4. Know what is expected</h1>\nIn my district, for example, we are expected to have objectives posted.\n\nI am going to be the first to admit that I am the worst at this. For this reason, I have more general overall monthly objectives for each subject area posted. I refer to these during lessons and then get more specific. For example, if our month long objective is to decode CVC words, I will say \"Today we are going to practice decoding words with a short a sound.\" to narrow that objective. Knowing that this is expected has helped me to prepare my classroom set up ahead of time to meet these needs, and it also keeps me focused during my instruction. Our students are also expected to know the purpose of different activities. Having most of the instruction during our day be small group provides a challenge in this area, especially when students are able to choose between 3 or 4 different writing activities, for example. (Read more about how I address the \"purpose problem\" here)\nMy district has also provided the rubric that they use to \"score\" us. I'm going to admit that I ignore thoughts of this during the actual observation, but instead look at what type of things the district is striving to see. I aim to incorporate these things into my routines.\n<h1>5.Invite the principal in often and early.</h1>\nOne of the biggest nail biters of this type of observation is that the principal may make assumptions based on what they see during this 10 minute slot. There are tons of benefits of having the principal come into your classroom early and often. The principal is a very special kind of visitor for your students to see. Your principal, your students, and you will all be more comfortable and prepared if you've established this type of relationship between your principal and your class.<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/?p=1347&amp;preview=true\">(Read more about inviting the principal here!)</a>\n<h1>6. Keep Calm and Pretend This is the Lesson Plan</h1>\nThis quote was on a coffee mug given to me by my classroom aide my first year teaching first grade. It has resonated so well with me!\n\nTake full advantage of the fact that your principal has not been prepped with a long and detailed lesson plan. \u00a0Keep teaching just as you would on a regular day. \u00a0Sometimes lessons take a turn we don't expect. Go with it. Just keep teaching. If the class needs a little motor break/ stretch, do it! Your principal wants to see what is happening each day in your classroom, not a scripted and rehearsed performance.\n\nSo are you ready to rock that informal observation?

    "content": "<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1451\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Copy-of-5.png\" alt=\"There are huge benefits to inviting your administrator into your classroom! It'll lead to a smoother school year, less disruptions, and more accurate teacher evaluations!\" width=\"331\" height=\"496\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI invite my principal into my classroom early and often... and you guessed it... I'm going to share the hows and whys of this approach with you today!\n<h1>Why Do I want my principal in my classroom?</h1>\n<strong><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">1.Get to know your principal and his/her perspective. \u00a0</span></strong>\n\nYou can get to know a lot about early and non-evaluative interactions with your principal. What kinds of activities do they value? Do they seem to mind a little bit of chatter? What questions do they have for you?\n\n<strong><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">2.You're doing awesome things and your principal wants to know about them!</span></strong>\n\nShow off the wonderful things your students are doing in the classroom! This is a great opportunity to showcase routines you love so your principal can get to know you as a teacher! Your principal wants to see and know about the awesome things happening in the school!\n\n<strong><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">3. You can schedule these early invited visits.</span></strong>\n\nIf you're nervous about those<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/?p=1344&amp;preview=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> informal observations</a>, which can be done at any time of the day, inviting the principal in is even MORE important! You have the ability to give your principal a glimpse into ideal times of the day with a really low key and non-evaluative tone!\n\n<strong><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">4. Your students will be familiar with the principal</span></strong>\n\nYour students will be much more likely to behave more \"normally\" when the principal comes in for <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/?p=1344&amp;preview=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">observations</a> or for a visit if they are used to seeing him/her in the classroom on a more regular basis! I have had those students who try to act out a bit when the principal comes into the room (aka throwing erasers across the room while side eyeing the principal). I have found that these behaviors tend to lessen as the principal visits more and more and is able to establish a relationship with the principal! If these visits aren't able to be very frequent, your students can even write letters, or leave a picture of something they've done in the principal's mailbox.\n\n<strong><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">5. Frequent visits give evaluative observations context.</span></strong>\n\nMany of the above points really lend themselves to giving your principal context. When it comes to <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/?p=1344&amp;preview=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">observations</a>, for example, your principal has a very limited time to see what's happening in your classroom. If you give him/her an opportunity to come into the classroom to see your daily routines, questioning techniques, and classroom management, \u00a0your principal is going to \"get the feel\" for your classroom. If something goes terribly wrong during your observation, your principal will know this is not how you run your classroom. If you choose to ignore negative behavior, your principal will know that student may have a behavior plan which requires this.\n<h1>When should I invite the principal to my classroom?</h1>\n<strong><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">1.Look for an early opportunity.</span></strong>\n\nThe beginning of the year is really a \"get to know you\" time of year! \u00a0Choose a get to know you opportunity for the principal to come participate in. \u00a0If you teach a visitor routine, ask the principal to pop in so your class can practice/ show their routine for visitors.\n\n<strong><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">2. During a creative activity you do!</span></strong>\n\nI have begun teaching through a lot of movement. This is unique kind of routine that we do in my classroom and is not a school wide approach, so I've invited the principal in to come see this activity. \u00a0I also do some really fun science/ STEM activities, so I'll often send my principal\n\n<strong><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">3.Invite the principal to read a story.</span></strong>\n\nStudents LOVE guest readers. This is a great way to build relationships between your students and the principal.\n\n<strong><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">4. Showcase student work.</span></strong>\n\nWhen students work hard on an activity, ask the principal to come in to see them share. If your principal is super busy, you can also invite him/ her to check out work in the hallway and come in to tell students what they think.\n<h1>How should I go about inviting the principal?</h1>\n<strong><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">1.Send a quick e-mail.</span></strong>\n\nI have found a quick e-mail to be the best way to reach the principal. I send a low pressure message like \"Good morning! My class has been working hard on ______ and would love for you to come take a peek!\" or \"Good Afternoon! My class has worked hard to build rafts for the gingerbread man! At 2:30 we're going to be testing them out if you'd like to swing by to check it out!\"\n\n<strong><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">2. Mention it in passing.</span></strong>\n\nYou can mention that you'd love the principal to come in to read a story to the class or come in for some sort of activity. This type of invite will probably need follow up, but this is a great way to plant the seed and let the principal know they're welcome!\n\n<strong><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">3. Have students make invitations.</span></strong>\n\nI usually employ this task once I have already verified that the principal can come if the invite is for a certain event (ie book performance). If it is a more open ended invite, like for a story time, I'll have students write to invite first.\n\nRemember that your principal is super busy too! He/ she may not be able to come into the classroom as much as you'd both like, but opening that door with invitations really does pay off , build a more positive school climate, and make for a more enriched experience for students, teachers, and administration!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me know how your visit went!\n\n<a href=\"http://printableprompts.us10.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=9b82a7dd6b84502a4bbf82a3d&amp;id=8fb90684d5\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1323 size-full\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Copy-of-Subscribe-Below-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://printableprompts.us10.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=9b82a7dd6b84502a4bbf82a3d&amp;id=8fb90684d5\">Have you had a chance to subscribe to my e-mail newsletter?

Color by number and color by word activities engage students in so many ways. For a FREEBIE and to find out the 5 reasons I LOVE Color by code activities, click to read more!\" width=\"420\" height=\"630\" /></a>I'm not sure who loves color by code activities more, my students or me?\n\nHere are the top five reasons I LOVE color by code activities!\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">Repeated skill practice</span></h1>\nThe types of skills I love to practice with color by code activities are math facts, sight words, and decoding. These are all skills that students require repeated practice with. \u00a0Repeatedly reading these words or solving the equations helps students to develop fluency with these skills.\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">Engaging format</span></h1>\nMy students LOVE color by code activities! They especially love ones that they don't know immediately what the picture is. It sometimes amazes me that my first graders cannot tell what the end picture will be when they see some of the color by code activities I give them (adults tend to see the patterns very quickly).\nI also love that my students are so engaged in the picture part that the reading and solving becomes like a second nature, solve by necessity type of task. I want students to be engaged in solving a bigger problem (reading a sentence, revealing a picture, solving a big problem) when they use these skills!\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">Easy to prep!</span></h1>\nOnce you have created or purchased this type of task, it is pretty much print and go! It works well in centers, during morning warm up, and is even simple enough to leave for any substitute.\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">Easy to differentiate</span></h1>\nI love creating and using color by code activities that can be differentiated! I have created color by number, color by sum to 10, and color by sum to 20 activities all with the same end picture. This is a great way to differentiate for learners to meet their needs, but in a more subtle way where they are all engaged in the same task!\n\nHere's an example of a differentiated resource for math!<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6yB_2tnJk3TXgxWWdzZmo2d00/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> (Click the picture for a link to these sheets in a freebie!)</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/5-reasons-i-love-color-by-code-activities/color-by-number-and-double-freebie1/#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1358\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1358\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/color-by-number-and-double-freebie1-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"251\" height=\"335\" /></a><a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/5-reasons-i-love-color-by-code-activities/color-by-number-and-double-freebie3/#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1359\"><img class=\"wp-image-1359 alignleft\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/color-by-number-and-double-freebie3-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"253\" height=\"337\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">Fine motor practice</span></h1>\nFor some reason many tasks which help students to develop fine motor skills are viewed as a \"waste of time\" to some teachers and administrators. For example, I have heard administrators ask \"are they just coloring?\" The thing is, as teachers, we know that students still need this practice. It improves their fine motor skills which is key in helping them to develop pencil grip and writing stamina! \u00a0This type of practice combines academics with fine motor practice!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you love color by code activities, I've created a bunch you can check out (and am working on even more!)\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://Color by code activities are sure to excite and engage young learners!\">Click here to see more!</a></p>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Color-by-Code-292862\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1353\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Color.png\" nopin= \"nopin\" alt=\"Color by code activities are sure to excite and engage young learners! \" width=\"290\" height=\"290\" /></a>",

I struggled through solutions, ultimately deciding on student created a thematic/ content area word wall (more about this later) displayed in the classroom, and changed monthly.\n\nHowever, something was missing. I was being asked 100 times per day \"How you you spell..\" I always reach for sticky notes to quickly scrawl the word, or reply with \"use your best first grade spelling.\" The problem was that my students weren't making good progress towards spelling words correctly consistently....\n\nAnd thus... a \"personal word wall\" was born! My earliest version involved a file folder, which worked wonders for my students! (Here's a teeny tiny version of it and <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/4-word-walls-that-work/\">here's where I wrote about it a couple years ago.</a>)\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-152 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wordwall.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"372\" height=\"279\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe effects grew further when I introduced their very own word booklets!\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">How I Set the Stage:</span></h1>\n*Sticky Notes are For Important Information: I launch this lesson much earlier in the year, but it teaches students about using sticky notes as a tool.\n\n*Continue to encourage students to continue to use their best spelling for most words by \"stretching out the sounds.\" This method does not replace inventive spelling, which we use in the classroom, but rather helps students to bridge to traditional spelling with common words.\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">How Do I Use Them?</span></h1>\n*I provided each student with their own small stack of sticky notes to keep in their pencil boxes. When they are struggling to spell a word or I notice they are misspelling a common word, we write the note on a sticky, and they stick it to the appropriate page.\n\n*When a student has mastered a word, or the thematic/ seasonal word is no longer needed, remove the sticky note! I have attached an envelope to the back of student books in the past in order for them to place the words they've mastered inside. \u00a0For my first graders, this part happens with my guidance usually as a part of conferences.\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">3 Awesome Things That Happened</span></h1>\n1. Increased Engagement: My students had a new excitement for writing. I can't say I was surprised though...they all love sticky notes don't they?\n\n2. \u00a0Increased Independence: Students gained independence with writing- \u00a0Initially I had a huge influx of those students needing words on sticky notes. This is to be expected and celebrated. It's like practice for the routine ahead, so I encourage it at first. \u00a0Before long, students stopped asking and started checking their books first. \u00a0Then slowly students started using their own resources (books, classroom labels, dictionary etc) to find the words they needed.\n\n3.Increased spelling abilities- With each student embracing his/her own personal goal and tracking their progress with their sticky notes, their spelling continued to improve!\n\nI've recently added my booklet to my shop if you'd like to use the full page or half page booklet templates I've created! <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Sticky-Note-Spelling-Reference-Booklet-3422862\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can find it here!</a>\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1431\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/original-3422862-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"269\" />\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Sticky-Note-Spelling-Reference-Booklet-3422862?aref=3auevthq\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1428\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/original-3422862-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"269\" /> <img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1430\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/original-3422862-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\" /><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1429\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/original-3422862-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"269\" /> </a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

They can help us to<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/teacher-planning-with-sticky-notes/\"> plan, make lists, move ideas</a>, and more\n\nI have been teaching reading comprehension with sticky notes for quite some time. The method became even more useful when I began using what I call a \u00a0\"modified workshop approach\" in my first grade classroom. If I handed students a full page response activity, they would sigh and walk to their spots with disappointment, however, if I handed them a sticky note to do the very same task, they lit up with excitement!\n\nI've decided to capture some of the prompts and activities I've asked students to do using sticky notes using sticky note comprehension mats. These mats are great to print on cardstock, laminate, and send students away to use them again and again! I tend to like students to place their sticky notes in their reading notebooks or on a large chart paper depending on the task at hand.\n<h1>Here is what a sticky note lesson might look like:</h1>\nCharacters:\n\nI tend to start students with identifying the parts of the story one by one. I usually start with character, since they are drawn to the people or animals with the action in the story.\n<h4>Step 1: Read a story (or refer to a familiar story).</h4>\n<h4>Step 2: Identify the characters together.</h4>\n<h4>Step 3: Sketch the characters on sticky notes.</h4>\n<h4>Step 4: Pass out familiar books to groups of 2-3 children.</h4>\nThese might be past favorite read alouds or books you've used in reading groups.\n<h4>Step 5: Group/ Guided practice</h4>\nStudents will reread/ scan through the book and work together to sketch characters and place their sticky notes on the mat.\n<h4>Step 6: Discuss</h4>\nThings that might come up are, \"We only had 3 characters\" or the opposite \"We had 5 characters\" This is a great time to address the logistical issues and how students can address them and solve these problems.\n<h4>Step 7: Give students sticky note mats and send them to read.</h4>\n<h4>Step 8: About halfway through reading time give each student 2 sticky notes.</h4>\nThis is where they will sketch characters from one story. \u00a0If they need more sticky notes, go ahead and offer them as needed.\n<h4>Step 9: Come back together to discuss characters they found on their sticky note mats.</h4>\n<h4>Step 10: Have students attach all character sticky notes to a large sheet of chart paper.</h4>\nThe next session I may have students read across many books during that time and collect characters from different stories!\n\nI have found this routine has really helped my students to participate in the task in an engaged way while using the sticky notes as a tool.\n\nI have created story part mats to address Character, Setting, Problem, Solution, and an overall Story Part mat here.\n\n<a href=\"http://printableprompts.us10.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=9b82a7dd6b84502a4bbf82a3d&amp;id=8fb90684d5\"> I have included a free sampling for my newsletter subscribers here!</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://printableprompts.us10.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=9b82a7dd6b84502a4bbf82a3d&amp;id=8fb90684d5\"><img class=\"wp-image-1456 size-shop_thumbnail aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Click-Here-To-Get-it-for-FREE-180x180.png\" alt=\"Sticky note comprehension mats are a great way to engage students!

Did I scare you? Ok , Ok I'm not scary, but do you know what is? Halloween time in the classroom! I am always looking for quick and easy things to do with my kiddos at Halloween time to keep them engaged and learning, while giving into a little bit of fun! I've also bundled them all into a resource you can grab if you're ready to print and go.\n<h3><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\"><strong>Here are 5 quick and easy activities you can do with your class!</strong></span></h3>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #603e9c;\">1.Pumpkin Lacing</span></strong></h4>\nI love to do this activity with my students all month long! I buy the foam pumpkins from the craft store in a pack of 30. With a 50% off coupon they cost me $3.50 which isn't bad at all! I like to put the lacing cards in morning tubs, and then they do one of their own to decorate and take home at the end of the month. I personally love to have them decorate with the foam sheets with sticker backings. I've also used cardstock to lace as well and if you laminated them first they might hold up! I have tried doing this activity by having students punch the holes and also punching the holes ahead of time.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Halloween-Activities-Hands-on-Fun-3455708\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1462\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Halloween-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"311\" height=\"311\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #603e9c;\"><strong>2.Letter Scramble</strong></span></h4>\nMy kiddos love these fun word activities! They are great for word work centers, book buddies, or even to do during Halloween centers during a class party! \u00a0I picked 4 fun word puzzles to include in my resource, but any fall or Halloween sayings will do! This activity is so easy to do! You can also do this even on the board or chart paper with sticky notes for your students to manipulate!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Halloween-Activities-Hands-on-Fun-3455708\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1461\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Halloween4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"295\" height=\"295\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #603e9c;\"><strong>3.KId created Halloween Bingo</strong></span></h4>\nThis is another great printable activity. It does take a little prep, but that prep is all the up to the kids! You print the bingo board and the pieces and then the students cut (color if you want) and glue them onto their board. You use an extra set of the picture pieces to play bingo! I have found that candies are the cutest little markers, but if this doesn't work for your students, any counters will do!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Halloween-Activities-Hands-on-Fun-3455708\"><img class=\"wp-image-1463 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/halloween-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"354\" height=\"354\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #603e9c;\"><strong>4.Roll and Cover</strong></span></h4>\nHow about a little fun Halloween math practice? This print and go game is great as a partner game or during math time on Halloween! I've included a counting, addition to 10, and a multiply by 5 version. I love that the kids can use this game again and again, so it's not something they are \"done\" with. You can also make the game a little trickier by \u00a0turning it into a bump game, where they can stack their pieces to lock their spot (by rolling the same answer twice) or bump someone if they roll something their partner has one piece on.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Halloween-Activities-Hands-on-Fun-3455708\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1464\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/halloween1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"339\" height=\"339\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #603e9c;\"><strong>5.Spin a monster</strong></span></h4>\nI'll admit it... I saved my favorite for last!\n\nUse this little spinner mat to spin a paperclip around a pencil to make a monster! You can either have it really be print and go by having the kids draw a monster as they spin through the boxes, or you can have them create a monster with clay/ dough which is a little more involved!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Halloween-Activities-Hands-on-Fun-3455708\"><img class=\"wp-image-1460 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Halloween5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"376\" height=\"376\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you try any of these ideas with your class, let me know how it went!\n\nIf you're like me at this time of year and want everything ready to go, I've posted this resource in my TPT shop!\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Halloween-Activities-Hands-on-Fun-3455708\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1459\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/5-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"361\" height=\"203\" /></a></p>",

Design a Leprechaun Trap.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1549\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-subtraction-write-the-room.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nI have my students design their own leprechaun traps leading up to St.Patrick's Day as a family/ at home project. They bring their traps in the day before St.Patrick's Day and share them with the class! I have also had students complete this<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/First-Grade-St-Patricks-Day-Activities-2377758\"> step by step- how to- booklet</a> at school when they share. I have actually had even more success sending it home with students as a part of their project so they can complete this at home as a part of their project.\n\nThis project is an awesome engineering project along with fine motor development, and of course it's also fun!\n\nThen of course we set the traps out the night before and watch to see if we can catch lucky!\n\nThe students are then always surprised when they come in the next day to see little leprechaun footprints all over their tables, and even their morning message! I prefer to use washable paint mixed with a drop of soap to make it extra washable,and a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WCZCFH1/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B06WCZCFH1&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=printableprom-20&amp;linkId=2366a6681fdd2fafbb1612f2d2a824ed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">footprint stamp (Amazon Link)</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=printableprom-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B06WCZCFH1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" />.

Although none of them catch the leprecahun, they each always seem to find a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IAHQ0K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004IAHQ0K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=printableprom-20&amp;linkId=269f79dbdfc6a791b20725f98bc19e23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leprechaun coin</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=printableprom-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004IAHQ0K\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /> left behind in their traps! Most excitingly, they find their very own note from Lucky! <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Notes-From-The-Leprechaun-St-Patricks-Day-3061496\">Here's a freebie with some examples of one's he's left behind before :-)</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Notes-From-The-Leprechaun-St-Patricks-Day-3061496\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1556 size-full\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/original-3061496-2.jpg\" alt=\"These super cute notes from lucky the leprechaun are perfect to leave on student leprechaun traps this st.patricks day... and they're free!\" width=\"350\" height=\"262\" /></a>\n\nThis is such a fun way to start St.Patrick's day with a little magic, and fun! It's also a great way to celebrate their projects!\n<h1>2. Greenprints for a Leprechaun House- Math Project</h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Math-Design-A-Leprechaun-House-Bundle-1708112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1548\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Copy-of-subtraction-write-the-room.png\" alt=\"Design a leprechaun math project supports counting and calculating area and perimeter\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\nIf you're ready to think about leprechaun living, this fun math project is super fun for students! Students create a \"Greenprint\" for a leprechaun house on grid paper. They can even brainstorm fun St.Patrick's Day inspired names for each of the rooms!\nThen, depending on your students, they can either <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Math-Leprechaun-House-Area-and-Perimeter-3659182\">calculate the area, perimeter, or both,</a> or just <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/K-1-St-Patricks-Day-Math-Leprechaun-House-Counting-Project-3659125\">count the number of boxes </a>in each room! You can find all the supporting materials here.\n\nI love to use some fun literacy extensions to this math project. My favorite is the \"real estate ad\"for the house they've designed, but there are also templates to write a letter to the leprechaun, and tell all about leprechaun life in this new home!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>3. Leprechaun Math Fact Practice Centers</h1>\nI have three fun math practice activities I like to do with my students on St. Patrick's Day! The fun thing is that fact practice type activities are so easy to differentiate between which operation you'd like to use, so many of these activities are offered in versions for addition, subtraction, and multiplication.\n\nFirst, students LOVE the math excitement of the Solve and Write the Room. It's like a math task card scavenger hunt as they search for the cards, solve, and write the equation! (I have versions for <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Math-Solve-and-Write-the-Room-Addition-to-10-and-20-3666588\">addition</a>, <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Math-Subtraction-Solve-and-Write-the-Room-3668166\">subtraction</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/StPatricks-Day-Math-Multiplication-Solve-and-Write-the-Room-3668203?aref=wirtep5o\">multiplication</a>).\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Math-Subtraction-Solve-and-Write-the-Room-3668166\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1550\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/subtraction-write-the-room.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\nSecond,I LOVE spinner activities! This<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Math-Fact-Center-2377254\"> leprechaun spinner game</a> is no exception! Print and laminate the spinners, attach a paperclip with a brass fastener. The different borders on the spinners help to differentiate which numbers students are working with. I like to place the recording sheets inside of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HN47UC6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01HN47UC6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=printableprom-20&amp;linkId=f662b460a20c8704e6144a49218f9926\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reusable Dry Erase Pocket</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=printableprom-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B01HN47UC6\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /> so they can continue the activity for their entire center time. This one also includes materials for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and fact families!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Math-Fact-Center-Leprechaun-Spin-and-Solve-2377254\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1558\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-subtraction-write-the-room.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\nThird, students love color by code activities! This is a great fun resource for students to practice math and numbers. I have St. Patrick's Day versions of <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Math-Fact-Center-2377254\">addition within 10</a> and <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Color-by-Number-Math-Activity-3553159\">numbers to 10.</a> (<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/5-reasons-i-love-color-by-code-activities/\">I've written more about color by code activities here</a>)\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Color-by-Number-Math-Activity-3553159\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1551\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-subtraction-write-the-room.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\nThe thing I love about these activities is that they really can be used in the days leading up to, and following St. Patrick's Day as well, since I find that kiddos can always use a little extra math practice.\n<h1>4. Rainbow Science &amp; Observations</h1>\nI like to have a science station going at least once a month where students watch something change over time (usually a few days).\nThis is a great one to start on St.Patrick's Day!\nAll you need is several white carnations, cups or vases, and some <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TOYK2U6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00TOYK2U6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=printableprom-20&amp;linkId=5fe3f7099ea5aae78c97a5a9012ca03d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">food coloring</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=printableprom-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00TOYK2U6\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" />. Sometimes we just leave some flowers out to observe and that silly leprechaun adds rainbow food coloring all on his own when he visits us! Then we watch as the color transformation happens over the next hours and days!\nI have created a little observation journal which can be used to record the changes students see! When the flowers have changed color, the students write little notes and we usually leave them on teachers and staff members desks as a little cheerful surprise! I use the science printables included in this <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/First-Grade-St-Patricks-Day-Activities-2377758\">First Grade St.Patrick's Day resource.</a>\n\nThe second rainbow fun activity we like to is the fizzy rainbow surprise activity!\nI use these <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NCIM2CL/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01NCIM2CL&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=printableprom-20&amp;linkId=f398bf4b469d21289690d087da2d1798\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Condiment Containers </a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=printableprom-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B01NCIM2CL\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" />. Ahead of time, fill them with a small spoonful of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K1JFC0S/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00K1JFC0S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=printableprom-20&amp;linkId=61c3b1364d39d56e56eb6d05fc13454f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arm &amp; Hammer Pure Baking Soda</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=printableprom-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00K1JFC0S\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" />, and then put a couple drops of food coloring right in the middle. Then cover with more baking soda so the color can't be seen.\n\nWhen students are ready for the activity I put some vinegar into cups, and they use <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P7QZDK4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00P7QZDK4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=printableprom-20&amp;linkId=29c1a6076ee92aad908286d458ad762c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Plastic Eye Droppers</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=printableprom-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00P7QZDK4\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /> to put some vinegar into the container. The reaction begins with the baking soda and vinegar, and before long a \"magical\" color appears!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1562\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-subtraction-write-the-room.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\nThis is always a fun way for us to spend our science time!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>5. I'm So Lucky Writing</h1>\nThere are a few ways to help students think about what makes them so lucky!\nFor younger students, I've had them write things they are lucky for on little shamrocks (I have a template that can be printed on green cardstock<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/First-Grade-St-Patricks-Day-Activities-2377758\"> included in this resource)</a>. Then they glue the shamrocks onto a headband/ sentence strip to show all that they are lucky for!\n\nI have also had students do some writing about what is valuable to them... worth more than gold!\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/First-Grade-St-Patricks-Day-Activities-2377758\">This writing template</a> is a unique way to help students think about the people and things that they are fortunate to have in their lives!\n6.

    "content": "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1574\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nWrite the room activities (and write and solve the room activities) are among my favorite center activities for my students. In my classroom, write the room activities consist of task cards hung around the room with pictures on them. Students go on sort of a scavenger hunt around the room to find the cards that match the pictures on their recording sheets. These activities make awesome centers, warm up, or morning work activities!\n\nThere are so many things I love about this type of practice, but here are three of the major reasons I love it!\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Oswald, sans-serif; font-size: 21px; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;\">1.You can adapt this type of practice to almost any subject area or practice skill!</span>\n\nOriginally I used write the room to practice our spelling words or phonics skill words. Originally this really consisted of students reading and then copying words. Soon my eyes were opened to so many more opportunities for practice including content area vocabulary, math skills and fact fluency, and even punctuation practice!\n<h2>2. The format/procedure is consistent allowing for increased independence with routines.</h2>\nNo matter what the subject matter, the basic procedure and routines are similar! In my classroom students practice using a clipboard to move around the room. We practice all together the first few times so they know what it feels, sounds, and looks like to be appropriately engaged in this center (and let's face it... first graders take clip boards VERY seriously!) Since the routine is pretty much unchanged, I can change out the cards and content tasks and provide challenges on a more independent basis since the students are so familiar with the procedure.\n<h2>3. Kids are MOVING while they practice!</h2>\nToss out those worksheets. Kids are required to do so much \"sit and produce\" work as it is. Some of it is avoidable... but when we have an opportunity for our students to get up and move, to be engaged in solving, reading, or whatever the focus skill is.... let's go for it!\n\n<strong>Here are some of my available Solve &amp; Write the Room resources!</strong>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/First-Grade-Math-Solve-and-Write-the-Room-Big-Bundle-3692918\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1576\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Copy-of-write-and-solve-addition-to-10-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"266\" height=\"266\" /></a>",

    "content": "&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1586\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Copy-of-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />Whether you've been teaching for years, or haven't landed your first full time gig yet, tutoring can pose some unique challenges which are much different than being in a classroom setting.\n\nI've taught third grade, first grade, worked as a teaching assistant and substitute, and still I sometimes get a little nervous before tutoring.\n\nHere are a few tips I've learned along the way to make getting started easier and communication a breeze.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Clarify all expectations early-</h3>\nUsually when you are privately tutoring, you are supporting a family. This means you are working for the parents in this situation, not a principal. This is a shift from the place you have in a classroom. It is really important to ask questions and be realistic about your expectations and goals. For example, you'll want to make sure the parent knows that learning is a process... and you're not sure exactly how much progress the child will make. You'll want to make sure you know the specific areas that the child has been struggling in,\u00a0 a little about their learning style, and what the teacher has reported as being areas of focus. With this information before the first session, you'll have already demonstrated an interest in the child and his/her progress as well as set the stage for positive learning!\n<h3>Plan to Work in a productive space at a productive time</h3>\nI have tutored at my home (for friends), in a public library, and in the child's home. I have found going to the family's home is typically the most productive for the child as long as there is a quiet place for you to work. Discussing the need for a quiet learning space is also a great expectation to set early on! I have personally found that places like the library tend to be a little too chaotic for the kiddos I work with. They are also often places where you feel the need to whisper or be quiet yourself, which can pose its own challenges.\n\nAlso always check which time the parent thinks is their child's prime learning time. If you are flexible in your scheduling, it will work best to use this time for both you and the child!\n<h3>Plan meaningful instruction- Make curricular connections</h3>\nIf you are working with a student individually, think about how you can connect the activities you are working with so that the student has a meaningfully experience. Sometimes, in the classroom setting, we are kind of forced to abruptly switch gears between subjects, and the connections aren't always there. Think about the objectives you'd like to work on and then use this opportunity to practice them in a number of ways and connect them to other objectives you're working on.\n<h3>Vary your activity type:</h3>\nIt can be really tempting to head over to TeachersPayTeachers, print a bunch of worksheets and head off to your tutoring session... but as you'll read next, this probably won't be enough. If you're working with a young struggling learner, this is definitely not going to be the most effective.\u00a0 I like to vary the type of activity that I do with my students. Some of the types of activities you might rotate through are hands on games, practice pages (worksheets), journaling, reading and discussing. Think about how you can vary these activities during your session!\n<h3>Do a practice run- and then add some:</h3>\nAn hour is a LONG TIME, especially for an early elementary student. You do not want to be in a situation where you do not have activities that will take enough time. Especially if you haven't worked with a child 1:1 or planned instruction in this way, it is important for you to sit down and really pace out your activities. See how many different activities you'd like to do... and then double it. ;-) Well you probably don't have to double it... but as a general rule, I always bring about 50% more\u00a0 than I plan to get to, especially in beginning sessions. A practice activity that may take a class 15 minutes, will probably take a child you are working with individually much less time!\n<h3>COMMUNICATE:</h3>\nContinue to communicate with the family after each session! This is so important. First, it will help them to know that you know how to help their child. It also offers an opportunity to share with parents little ways they can help their child throughout the week! I never leave a packet of stuff to be done unless a parent specifically requests it... generally I like to leave the materials for a game we have practiced or a routine we have practiced that can be more naturally incorporated throughout the week.\n\nHere's the communication sheet I use (Click the image to get it for free:-) )\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tutoring-report.pdf\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1584\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tutoring-report.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"296\" height=\"394\" /></a>\n\ntutoring report",

In fact, it was the one subject I felt worried about teaching my first year, and quickly became a personal professional goal of mine. As I became aware of more and more math manipulatives, and saw how they empowered my students and unlocked those \"Aha\" moments in their minds, I was suddenly excited about the possibilities of teaching math to my students! In fact, my first graders love to visit the \"math buffet\" to select the tools that will help them to solve problems and complete their math tasks of the day. These specific manipulatives help my students to solve addition, subtraction, and place value problems within 100.\n\nHere are 5 of my favorite math manipulatives for first graders (and a few honorable mentions).\n\n<em>This post contains affiliate links as a part of the Amazon Affiliate program.

    "content": "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1609\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nIt's that time of year... the time when behavior management issues start to pop up! Maybe it's because of the wonky school schedules, the wearing off of the beginning of the year \"honeymoon\" period, or the sniffles and sicknesses setting in... but this time of year I always had those kiddos who need a little more structure for behavior expectations bubble up during this time. First of all, and most importantly reach out the to family of the child to chat about the behaviors in a productive way (and ALWAYS have something nice to say!) and offer the behavior plan as a strategy to help with the situation. Also reach out to the teachers and support staff in your building as needed. They may have some insight into the behavior and some suggestions, since behavior management is such an individual process.\n\nI'm going to share with you the three step approach I took to pick a behavior management plan, as well as one little secret I learned along the way!\n<h1>Step 1: Observe</h1>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1851\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-design-91.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nObserve the child. Notice the behaviors you're seeing and the frequency of the behaviors. I sometimes use a little notebook template, and sometimes I just jot down the behaviors I see and make tally marks. This also serves as great data if you end up needing to move to a higher level of behavior support.\n<h1>Step 2: Target</h1>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1850\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-design-92.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nHere's the secret... when you're choosing the behavior to target for intervention...Choose 1 teeny tiny small behavior to target first. <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/behavior-and-classroom-management-setting-a-behavior-goal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(more about this here)</a>\n\nThe advice I once got from a very well respected mentor of mine was to choose the one thing that drove me nuts the most. This is usually the thing most disruptive to instruction and the overall classroom management.\n\nChoose a way to track this behavior visually for the student. (more about this later). I usually have a checklist of the time frames during the day and the student either does or doesn't earn the check or star or whatever way they desire to mark that space.\n<h1>Step 3: Implement</h1>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1852\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-design-90.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nI implement the behavior management plan, and checklist, with the input of the student. We have a private conversation about the behavior. It's not a shameful situation, it's an empowering and goal setting situation. This sets the stage for the plan to take affect! Give the student some input as to how they will mark their chart, where it will be kept etc. You can also choose to have a reward of some kind if you wish (I sometimes offered time reading to another class etc.) I also set the limitations about what will happen if they are not to meet the expectations ( Here's a rough example: \"You will have one friendly reminder. The reminder will look like/ sound like this. If the behavior continues, then you will not earn your mark\")\n\nThe super important parts of implementation are modeling the behavior, cueing the desired behavior, and checking back in frequently throughout the day. (more about each of these steps later).\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/behavior-and-classroom-management-setting-a-behavior-goal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I've written about all three steps in more depth in a separate post here, but I hope this overview can help you to kind of focus the process and find a place to start!</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're looking for these supporting materials to help you to implement a behavior management plan for a student, check this prepared teaching resource out here:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Behavior-Management-Plan-Supporting-Materials-4090028\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://ecdn.teacherspayteachers.com/thumbitem/Behavior-Management-Plan-Supporting-Materials-4090028-1537984562/original-4090028-1.jpg\" alt=\"Behavior Management Plan Supporting Materials\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;",

Ned is crawling on the carpet, spinning his body around, calling out, making loud noises, and even jumping onto and off of tables from time to time. In addition, he's not even getting his work done or participating in any part of the curriculum. It might be tempting to make some goals related to each part of Neds behavior. For example, I may say that Ned's goals are to *sit nicely at meeting/lesson time *raise his hand before speaking\u00a0 *keeping a safe body\u00a0 * completing\u00a0 his work.\n\nHere's the issue with designing a behavior plan with all 4 of these parts of Ned's behavior... Ned One of the things I had the hardest time wrapping my mind around was the concept of choosing a small goal, a really tiny measurable goal, when a child in my class may be totally out of control.\u00a0 Let's call this student Ned (not a real student name). Ned is crawling on the carpet, spinning his body around, calling out, making loud noises, and even jumping onto and off of tables from time to time. In addition, he's not even getting his work done or participating in any part of the curriculum. It might be tempting to make some goals related to each part of Neds behavior. For example, I may say that Ned's goals are to *sit nicely at meeting/lesson time *raise his hand before speaking\u00a0 *keeping a safe body\u00a0 * completing\u00a0 his work.is having difficulty monitoring his behavior. It is going to be super difficult for him to monitor all of these behaviors at once. More importantly it is going to leave Ned open to find failure throughout the day. He can be meeting one of those goals well, but because he feels like he has forgotten about or failed at the other parts, in my experience, Ned's behavior continues to be more out of control.\n\nInstead, the best advice I had when designing these plans was- choose the behavior that drives you most nuts (which is usually the most disruptive behavior to the class) . In Ned's case, I decided that \"stay in my spot\" was the most important because it would help him to keep himself and others safe.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1850\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-design-92.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"334\" height=\"188\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI also want to add that giving a very vague goal to a student in this situation (like \"be responsible\") has also not been effective in my experience, or at least not as effective as choosing one small goal. Kids have a very hard time monitoring or understanding how multifaceted this type of goal is. Instead, choose something that is concrete that the student can wrap his/her head around and actually see and feel.\n\nTalk to Ned about what it means to be in his spot at meeting time, seat work time, center time etc. feels and looks like.\u00a0 Practice and preset Ned ahead of time to set him up for success as you transition. Give tons of negative feedback and CUE the behavior. You can even cue the whole class \"Boys and girls, it's time to transition. I'll be looking for everyone to find and stay in their meeting spot now please.\" Ned will be preset and know just what to do!\n\nHere's the tricky part... once you've chosen that teeny tiny goal- let the rest of it go. That means that when Ned calls out in the middle of meeting, ignore this as much as possible. Do NOT react by marking his check in chart about this behavior. If Ned has created havoc at meeting, but has stayed in his spot... he earns the check/ star or whatever mark on his chart you've agreed to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you want to monitor all of these parts of Ned's day, I recommend keeping those notes to yourself, and instead consider choosing just ONE of those goals to model, practice, and track/ check in with Ned about.\u00a0 In fact, in my experience it's been pretty awesome to continue to monitor these aspects of behavior because here's the amazing thing I've discovered...\n\nOnce one of these behaviors falls into place, often the rest of them follow! For example, after several days/weeks of practicing being in his spot, Ned is more apt to be available to listen and interact with morning meeting. He will be more likely when he is in his seat to engage in his seat work rather than table jumping.\u00a0 Every time I have used this approach I have seen kids transform in amazing ways.\n\nIf a student has mastered one of the goals and seems to be still struggling with another goal, have a goal setting meeting with your student. Change the goal. Start again right from the beginning.\u00a0 Taking this slow going approach is not always easy or fast, but it's always worth it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Behavior-Management-Plan-Supporting-Materials-4090028\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">If you're looking for some materials to support implementing a specific behavior plan for a student, I have created a set of forms you might find useful here!</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Behavior-Management-Plan-Supporting-Materials-4090028\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1853\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Untitled-design-89.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Behavior-Management-Plan-Supporting-Materials-4090028\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://ecdn.teacherspayteachers.com/thumbitem/Behavior-Management-Plan-Supporting-Materials-4090028-1537984562/original-4090028-1.jpg\" alt=\"Behavior Management Plan Supporting Materials\" /></a>",

But as much as I love reading with and to my students... as much as I loved listening to discussions... I wasn't really sure how to balance writing good chapter questions.\n\nIn the beginning I struggled with the urge to ask questions to check on my students because I\u00a0 had some sort of lack of trust that they are doing what they are supposed to be doing.\n\nWhen I entered the classroom as a full time teacher it was super important to me that I was asking questions to get my students thinking and talking... not just for holding them accountable.\u00a0 One of my favorite novel study questions I've ever created and used was for the book <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ca332ba8-f4f8-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/chocolate-touch-novel-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Chocolate Touch</a>.\u00a0 I feel like this was the very first time that I really dug into a book and thought about how the interesting questions I could ask would give my students something to think and talk about. Rather than being purely a \"check up\" they would be the kinds of questions that would spark new ideas and thoughts and great discussions.\n\nFor this reason, when I design chapter question resources or journal responses for students I like to include 4 main components:\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f05b5b;\">1.Literal Questions-</span></h1>\nThese are our \"right there\" questions. These types of questions are great for getting our students to look into the text. It's a great precursor to finding relevant text evidence when they go on to write more complicated responses. This is also a way to set our students up for success, especially our struggling learners. There is usually very little guesswork to the answer to these types of questions. These types of questions often start with the words\u00a0 \"Who\", \"Where\", and \"What\".\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An example of one of these questions in my <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ca332ba8-f4f8-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/chocolate-touch-novel-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chocolate touch resource</a> is <strong><em>\"What did John find on the road\".\u00a0</em></strong>\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f05b5b;\">2. Inferential Questions</span></h1>\nThese are our \"dig deeper\" types of questions that ask students to really think about what's happening in the story. Many times these questions don't have a \"correct answer\" per se, but a few answers that, if supported by evidence, could be valid. These are often times our \"Why\" questions. They are also questions that ask students to predict based on what they've read or evaluate and connect to the text. I don't usually include loosely related connection questions, but instead \"Do you think...\" questions about what the characters are doing. This type of questioning requires the student to think about what they know... what is happening... and draw a conclusion, either about a character or event.\u00a0 An example of this type of question is:<em><strong> \"Do you think John should have told his mother about the chocolate?\"\u00a0</strong></em>\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f05b5b;\">3.Vocabulary and language connections-</span></h1>\nHere is where it might look like I am asking for looser connections from students for the purpose of having them use vocabulary words from the text in a meaningful way so that they can connect back to the behaviors and feelings of the characters in the story. Here's an example about one of these type of questions:<strong><em> \"Mrs. Midas was puzzled when John didn't want the dime. When have you been puzzled?\"\u00a0</em></strong>\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f05b5b;\">4. Discussion/ Thematic launch Question</span></h1>\nThis type of question I call my Find, Mark, Discuss question. It is often an overarching question. Sometimes it changes chapter by chapter, but often it is the type of question that we continue to explore throughout the book. For example, in The Chocolate Touch, most of the chapters have the question \"Find parts that describe the changes that have happened to John. Are the changes good or bad?\" For these questions, I don't have students write anything except page numbers. I often have them mark their texts with sticky notes. This is their discussion launch question.\u00a0 All of this discussion leads up to a great end of book question, which requires students to look back in the text and use evidence...<strong><em> \"Do you think having the chocolate touch was a good thing or a bad thing?\"\u00a0</em></strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere's an example of how I put it all together for each chapter!\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ca332ba8-f4f8-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/chocolate-touch-novel-study\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1626\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/the-chocolate-touch1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"442\" height=\"589\" /></a>\n\nUsing this approach to writing chapter questions has helped my students to engage, be focused, and have really great discussions and deeper comprehension!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're interested in the chapter questions I discussed in this post, you can find them <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ca332ba8-f4f8-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/chocolate-touch-novel-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here!</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ca332ba8-f4f8-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/chocolate-touch-novel-study\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1628\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/original-1786001-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"297\" height=\"297\" /></a>\n\nMy second favorite book companion is for <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cc1c9632-f68f-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/stone-fox-novel-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stone Fox</a>!\n\nYou can find that one <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cc1c9632-f68f-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/stone-fox-novel-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cc1c9632-f68f-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/stone-fox-novel-study\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1631 size-full\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/original-1775472-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Book-Companions-292848\">For more book companions check this out</a>",

    "content": "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1636\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5-ways-to-use-color-by-code.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />As the school year is off to a good start, I like to reflect upon and think about the ways that I use certain activities, or types of activities in my classroom.\n\nOne of my favorite category of resources to create and use (and one that has always been a student favorite) is the color by code category. These are our color by number, color by letter, color by word (sight word or vocabulary), or math fact color by code. <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/5-reasons-i-love-color-by-code-activities/\">I talk more about why I love color by code here</a>... but in this post I'm going to dive right into 5 ways that I use color by code in the classroom.\n<h1>Center activity</h1>\nWhether it's a literacy or math center, color by code resources are designed for repeated practice of a skill. Whether it's identifying a letter or number, reading a word, or solving an equation.\u00a0 Color by code activities are generally independent activities which also help with classroom management during the times that other hustle and bustle might be going on in the classroom. I usually have had a teacher center, partner or group game, and then a third fluency center. The other two centers are more hands on and engaged in noisy play/learning, so color by code pages make for a great center activity.\n<h1>Morning Tub/ Morning Work</h1>\nComing into the day with a quiet but fun activity is great. I often use an independent, not stretch skill, color by code practice when it comes to morning work. I turn on some quiet music and then I'm able to go about greeting the students as they enter, and they can be engaged in practice. Kids also seem to really love to color when they first come in during the day, so this is kind of a happy medium between coloring and skill review.\n\nEarly finishers-\n\nI often have differentiated color by code activities in my classroom, so when I have early finishers with our math work or center of the day, a color by code page is a great activity for them to go to. They know how to do it, so they can really transition to this activity independently, I can choose one at a level that is appropriate for the student, and its easy for them to stop part way through, so even if they have just 5 minutes, they can get started and then pull it out the next time they have early finisher time.\n<h1>Homework</h1>\nI tended not to send homework home at all in the form of worksheets to my students. However, I often did have parents asking for some pen and pencil math fact or sight word practice for their struggling learner. Since I can differentiate the activities and choose one that's just right for what my student needs, it is a great and more fun (than a regular worksheet) way for students to practice at home. The image is also self correcting, so if the picture doesn't look right, the student will be alerted that they have made an error.\n<h1>Substitute Plans</h1>\nOne time when I almost always leave color by code pages is when there's a substitute. Again, since the students know how to do it, it's an easy type of activity for a sub to do. It's also great as an extra activity to leave, since you always want that type of activity that takes some time to complete in case the other plans you've left are finished early.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFour of my favorite sets of color by code resources are my seasonal resources since they apply for several months at a time (don't get me wrong... I also LOVE the holiday sets I've created).\n\nHere are four of my favorites.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Summer-Color-By-Code-Math-Bundle-4136730\"><img class=\"wp-image-1637 alignleft\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/original-4136730-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fall-Color-By-Code-Math-Bundle-4130351\"><img class=\"wp-image-1640 alignleft\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/original-4130351-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Winter-Color-By-Code-Math-Bundle-4130462\"><img class=\"wp-image-1639 alignleft\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/original-4130462-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Spring-Color-By-Code-Math-Bundle-4130520\"><img class=\"wp-image-1638 alignleft\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/original-4130520-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're looking for some great math and phonics color by code resources, I've been working on creating a whole set of differentiated literacy and math color by code resources, you can find them <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Color-by-Code-292862\">here</a>!\n\n&nbsp;",

Well , if I'm being honest, first it was a great mystery to me. I was afraid when I began my educational training that I would never be able to \"teach\" students how to read? Watching it come true as a first grade teacher years later still feels like magic every single time. I have changed perspectives, identifying more as a \"coach\" to my students rather than the keeper of the secrets to reading.\u00a0 One major advantage to this sort of student centered thinking has definitely been an increase in student independence with routines, yes even in first grade!\n\nIn search of a streamlined routine to use during reading groups during a year where interruptions were inevitable due to the student needs in my class, I began trialing some routines during guided reading groups that may work with (almost) any story and that students could internalize and build independence with.\u00a0 My reading prompt cards were born.\n\nThis set basically contains question prompts that can be applied to pretty much any narrative story (as well as one or two which can be used with informational text) and help students, in a really basic way, answer the \"right there\" literal questions, as well as determine importance, identify story elements, retell, and make predictions. The text and explanatory graphics on each card give students the visual cues that help all my beginning readers access the text. Even very basic emergent reader texts can be addressed with questions such as \"What is the most important part\".\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">There are five basic components to this resource:</h2>\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4>Picture and word reading comprehension question cards.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1652\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_20190102_144400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"298\" /></h4>\n</li>\n \t<li style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4>Written response pages<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Reading-Comprehension-Guided-Reading-1580805\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1648\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a></h4>\n</li>\n \t<li style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4>Sticky note templates<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Reading-Comprehension-Guided-Reading-1580805\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1650\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"225\" /></a></h4>\n</li>\n \t<li style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4>Student tracking sheet<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Reading-Comprehension-Guided-Reading-1580805\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1651\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"226\" height=\"224\" /></a></h4>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Guided reading planning sheet</h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\nToday I am really going to focus on how I use the first three components of this resource in different reading settings in order to increase independence with reading comprehension, reading routines, and even meaningful questioning.\n<h2>Guided Reading Groups:</h2>\nDuring small group instruction these cards are invaluable to me! Of course, as with all routines, I model and we practice each question card as a model. The card is placed on the table while reading the text, then students are asked when they are done reading to answer the question and find a page (or paragraph for more advanced readers) that helped them to decide on the answer. Then they practice whisper reading that page of evidence until we're ready to share ( see how that fluency sneaks in there?). This is a great way to manage the downtime when students are waiting for others to finish reading. It also is great because if I need to leave the table to address an urgent need during group, the students know what to do once they have finished reading the text.\n\nAfter some time, we have a group leader for the day. This person chooses the question card for the group. This is a great way to help students really have ownership of their reading discussions.\n\nSometimes, I even use the sticky note templates to print the question of the day onto sticky notes. This is especially helpful as the year goes on and my students may be spending some time doing reading on their own. This is a great way for them to remember the question cue wherever they are, and they can plop the sticky note right on their evidence.\n\nI honestly very rarely have students complete written response to text during guided reading time, however, you definitely could use the matching written response templates to capture their answers during this time.\n<h2>Reading Workshop</h2>\nA few years ago, my school began adopting components of the reading workshop model. The sticky note templates REALLY helped to keep my students focused as they were reading. I printed one copy of each sticky note and attached it to a laminated piece of paper as a bookmark. Students could then even choose a question they could answer using the text and then reuse the sticky note a few times.\n<h2>Partner Reading:</h2>\nWhen my students are reading with a partner, I want to build independence with questioning so that they are engaging in more authentic reading discussions. Each \"Buddy Box\" (which is basically a pencil box with some materials for working with partners) has a set of the question cards, and reading bookmark with each of the sticky notes. This gives students a great entry point into discussing the text.\n<h2>Literacy Centers:</h2>\nDuring center rotations, using these same prompts to short texts, books on CD (or online), or to independent reading is a great way to streamline student work and decrease the need for interruptions for students not knowing how to complete the task.\n\nI used the written response pages often at the listening center. I usually left 2-3 different questions and prompts in the area so they could choose which to respond to.\n\nI also sometimes use these during their independent reading rotation. I usually leave one centers as a bin of seasonal or thematic books and completing a written response to one of these prompts is a great way to help students practice building comprehension.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you have additional reading group routines, I'd love to hear them!",

In fact I have a whole set of posts planned out to share about how I planned for my maternity leave from my first grade classroom, but they slip away from my mind as time goes on, only to resurface when a friend asks questions planning for their upcoming maternity leave.\n\nThere are tons and tons of worries that I had leaving my class behind. I worried that their routines would be disrupted, somehow the information about them that I had received during what I felt like was some sort of instructional osmosis would be lost. I worried that the new teaching coming in would feel lost if I didn't leave enough guidance but smothered if I left too much.\n\nI felt like I didn't even know where to start... but when I did, I found this step to really ease the worry and set me on a path to organize for a maternity in a way that put my mind at ease.\n\nIt seems so basic... but it was so worth the time...\n\nI took a daily \"Teacher Time Inventory\"\n\nWhat did it look like? Well not this pretty. It was actually on a series of sticky notes and scrap papers which I later typed up, but in hindsight, I wish I had a page like this to use myself, so I'll share this one with you.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1658\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Copy-of-step-1-for-maternity-leave-planning.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nHere are the 5 things I focused on when taking a time inventory:\n\n*Identify \"chunks\" of\u00a0 instructional time during the day. This probably includes all the major time frames offered on your posted daily schedule, or even ones written up in your sub plans. These times are like \"math, reading, writing\" you get the idea.\n\n*Identify\u00a0 non instructional chunks of teacher time- this includes the morning before the kids came in,\u00a0 lunch, plan time, after school, and at home work in addition to all the major academic areas of the day that would typically be included in sub plans.\n\n* Teacher inventory: I just wrote down what I did during each time period, with special notes of things I sort of did on autopilot. I really focused on what I was doing during each time period on this first day as far as recording.\n\n*Determine importance and trends- Sometimes I wrote down things that I did that I realized were unnecessary or that were short term sort of tasks that likely a sub wouldn't need to repeat. I really wanted this chart to serve more as a basic checklist or even table of contents for me as I began to plan.\n\nWhat I found was that there were so many things I just did automatically each morning, during plan time, or during each afternoon that really helped our day flow smoothly and ensured that I was prepared for the instructional day ahead.\u00a0 Small things like rotating the card for helpers, or the special for the day can cause a disruption in student arrival, for example, because they become like little police of that environment and those routines.\n\nI also found that some of my routines I had naturally done at certain times of the day on purpose, that if just left in a big list of things to do, might have taken a bit of time for a brand new teacher to learn. For example, writing our daily message in the afternoon before leaving for the day helped in case there was an emergency and I had to be absent. It also helped because the little focuses of the day were still fresh in my mind, so it was easier for me to pick literacy and math focuses for our meeting times right then.\n\nThere were also some tasks that I really would rather do at home (like stapling book order forms together). Of course the substitute may choose to do things a little differently, but why not offer what I have found to work even if they don't follow it!\n\nYou'll notice the third column of the chart is for students. I filled this in during a secondary \"routine inventory\" so I could also be thinking about the little things that made our day go smoothly.\n\nThere will be much more to come on this topic, but if you have an upcoming long term leave or maternity leave, consider inventorying your day before you begin to plan too much for the sub. If nothing else, you might find some ways to make your own days more efficient... and I think any teacher getting ready for a maternity leave can use all the efficiency she can manage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere are the files for you to use if you'd like, or if you come up with another way to inventory your time, please share below!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/teacher-time-inventory.pdf\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1664\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/teacher-time-inventoryp1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"148\" height=\"192\" /></a>\n\nAnd here's my first shot at something editable...\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Teacher-time-inventory-editable.pptx\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1662\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/teacher-time-inventoryp3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"148\" height=\"192\" /></a>",

I don't know if I love them more, or if my students do.\n\nTypically if I want to snazz up a reading lesson, all I have to do to boost engagement is somehow involve a sticky note or two for my students.\n\nMy tasks and organization became even more efficient when I discovered the power of printing on sticky notes!\n\nHere are the basic steps for printing on sticky notes!\n<h1>Print Your template</h1>\nIf the resource you're printing has a blank template, print this first.\n\nIf not, you can print the sticky note sized template you'd like to use and just place sticky notes over the parts you'd like to appear on the sticky notes.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_20190107_150019.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1668\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_20190107_150019.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"425\" height=\"319\" /></a>\n<h1>Place your sticky notes over the template</h1>\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_20190107_150054.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1669\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_20190107_150054.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"425\" height=\"319\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Place your page in the printer</h1>\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_20190107_150139.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1670\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_20190107_150139.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"425\" height=\"319\" /></a>\n\nBe sure to place the page so that the sticky part goes in first, otherwise they'll peel off and get stuck in your printer!\n<h1>Print the page you'd like on your sticky notes</h1>\nAnytime you're printing a template like this, be sure you're not selecting the fit to page option.

Teaching reading is my passion and I want to keep students engaged in meaningful activities while I meet and confer with small groups of students.\u00a0 One of my favorite word work centers is word building mats. These mats are so versatile. They have common word family\u00a0 endings and students fill in letters at the beginning of the word in order to make a word.\u00a0 This is a great way to practice chunking word families and is true segmenting and blending practice.\n\nOne of the great things about these mats is that when you change out the materials you're using to build the onset of each word, it's like\u00a0 you have a new center! The same is true if you change up the graphics on the mat seasonally, or only pull out the mats that are applicable to the skills the students are practicing.\n\nAdditionally, so many of these activities are also ways to build and develop fine motor skills which is still critical for our beginning readers!\n\nHere are my favorite 5 materials to use during Word Building\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">1.Play dough</h1>\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-52.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1688\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-52.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"341\" height=\"341\" /></a>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">2.Pipe Cleaners</h1>\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-54.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1690\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-design-54.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"348\" height=\"348\" /></a>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">3.

It was overwhelming at a time when I had so much on my plate already.\n\nHere are a few things I learned along the way that really helped make the transition as smooth as possible.\n<h1>*Get That Substitute in Your Classroom As Much as Possible!</h1>\nThis seems like a no brainer, but it was SUCH a gift that the sub hired to cover my leave was already a TA in the school I work at. With support of our administration she was able to schedule to support students in my classroom during both reading and math (I LOVE push in support!). Not only did she know the students, but she knew many of our basic routines and our classroom community.\nIf your sub is not already working in your school, then invite him/her in if you have any special events or celebration in the days leading up to your leave!\n<h1>*Introduce your substitute as their teacher</h1>\nI actually tend to introduce any adults who work in my classroom as their teachers. I don't do the \"aide\" or \"helper\" language with students. It's just another teacher. This has been SO beneficial as far as helping to pass off a class. There's not that \"You're not my teacher\" mentality.\n<h1>*Use Google Drive!</h1>\nI shared a folder in my google drive with my sub. I took leave from Feb-June so she had lots of time to cover, and I was taking a substantial unpaid leave, so I was not expected to leave detailed plans. Sharing past resources and curricular pacing charts via google drive helped make access and communication so much easier!\n<h1>*Leave your plan book behind!</h1>\nIt was difficult. I am emotionally attached to my plan book, but I left it behind! I still keep a paper plan book with quick 2-3 word descriptions of activities. I think it ends up being helpful for that substitute to see how you planned/ paced things out.\n<h1>*Keep a plan template and type up \"Substitute\" plans</h1>\nThis tip just helped me to sleep (when I could... 15 min at a time...) I spent about 15 min each Sunday using a \"planning template\" that I created early in the year. It has the time of each lesson and our routines already in there for each day. I click save as, title it for the new week, and fill in the curricular activities for the week. This helped me wrap my mind around \"What would happen if my water breaks today!\" I also left two weeks of detailed plans typed like this as well as all the copies for my sub. It let her take some time to breathe and deal with the daily responsibilities before jumping into prep.\n<h1>*Introduce your substitute to parents early and reassuringly!</h1>\nMy substitute was hired around a parent/ teacher conference time, so I had a wonderful opportunity to let the parents know who would be taking over and how excited I was about it.\n\nI also had a little Q &amp; A that I added to my monthly newsletter that was \"Meet the new teacher!\" along with a note from me about how blessed I was to be a part of their child's first grade year and how excited I was for all the learning and fun that was to come with their new teacher.\n<h1>*Ask the students to write introduction letters/ welcome cards</h1>\nMy students had SO much fun writing letters introducing themselves and telling the new teacher things they think are REALLY important for their new teacher to know! They also made cards welcoming her, which I left on the desk for her first day. I think these letters helped them realize that this transition was really happening, and it helped her gain information about them as to what they shared, and also as a quick little writing sample!\n\n&nbsp;",

List of Assessments and Due Dates</h1>\nThink about district wide assessments and their due dates as well as\n<h1>3.Teacher colleague contacts</h1>\nThink about special education teachers, principal , reading specialist, team members, school psychologist, or other staff members who they may need to contact.\n<h1>4.List of meetings/ important dates</h1>\nThink about regularly scheduled meeting dates, PLC meetings, PD meetings, as well as important dates such as assemblies.\n<h1>5. Bus/ Dismissal list</h1>\nInclude which buses students go on, or if they are dismissed to parent pick up or to an after school care program.\n<h1>6.List of school accounts/login information</h1>\nThink about any classroom accounts you might use on a regular basis. Think of any programs students use that have teacher access (our school used Scholastic, Scholastic News, Reading A-Z etc).\n<h1>7. Thematic/ Curricular units</h1>\nI always like to have some sort of thematic tie in for each time of the year, listing out themes such as ducks, butterflies, or even our CARES Unit. You can also list things like phonics skills or math units that will need to be covered.\n<h1>8. Reading and Math Groups (if applicable)</h1>\nList the students in differentiated groups as well as maybe a few notes about how and when you create or mix up the groups. I also like to leave two lists of \"friendly parings\" for the sub to choose from to make partner work easier those first few days.\n<h1>9. \"Menu\" of activities for each curricular time- Reading, Writing, Math etc.</h1>\nI use a guided small group approach during almost every time of the day. Listing out activity types/ choices. For example, I list different center types for writing center (card writing, journal writing, silly sentence center etc). This gives the substitute a good start when it comes to planning center rotations.\n<h1>10.Routines</h1>\nThink about times of day when your class really thrive on routines. Maybe it makes sense for you to list transition signals. Maybe you list routines for lining up, or even morning meeting activities.\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12TUjUN6Dzh0XIb3uXO47GfjQds_m8Y2vXg6fZ3U8DP4/copy?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">If you'd like to use this very basic table template in Google Presentation you can click here for the link.

I'll share my working definition of a research companion and a brief explanation of how I use them in my classroom:\n\n<strong>A Research companion</strong> is a set of materials that supports students as they read and learn about a certain topic. For me, it usually includes graphic organizers (sometimes more than one choice like a web organizer and a can,have,are graphic organizer),\u00a0 writing pages (I like to include multiple line sizes). I've also used anticipation guides now and then or a KWL chart.\n\nI like to use these guides to support students by having the topic listed on the graphic organizers and writing pages as well. I also like to have some sort of graphic or clip art drawing of the topic. They are great for building independence like in a research center, writers workshop, or during writing lessons.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Pet-Research-Companion-Dog-Free-4402680\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here are some examples from a favorite Dog Research Companion, which you can get for Free here!</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Pet-Research-Companion-Dog-Free-4402680\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://ecdn.teacherspayteachers.com/thumbitem/Pet-Research-Companion-Dog-Free-4402680-1554754940/original-4402680-1.jpg\" alt=\"Pet Research Companion Dog Free\" /></a>\n\nI'll write more about research companions soon, but if you'd like to check out some of the ones <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/My-Products/Category:292837\">I've created and used- Click here!\u00a0</a>",

At that point, with my lack of experience I didn't really mind either way. All I knew was that it made it easier for me to submit my subject units when they weren't really tied together.\n\nI heard teachers saying things like \"Thank goodness I don't have to go out and find worksheets with seashells on them for ocean week anymore.\" Before I began creating my own themed resources, I was worried about the exact same thing. After all, did the seashells on the page actually provide students with opportunities for deeper learning?\n\nThen something happened... I began teaching. It became my job to engage young learners. It became my job to light them up to learning and get them excited about all there was to know and discover in the world.\n\nThis was also around the implementation of the common core and teachers were wondering how to ever include informational text and learning in the classroom, particularly at the kindergarten and first grade levels. What did all this mean, and how would we manage to teach all these new units to our students? The wonderful team I was working with at the time had never really let thematic units go, and that sure was a gift at this time in our teaching journeys!\n\nThe key for my students was... you guessed it... thematic units! I am definitely talking about old school topics, penguins, cats, pumpkins etc.\n<h1>Here are the reasons I love thematic units</h1>\n<h2>1.Engaging-</h2>\nStudents are excited to learn and explore stories about different topics. They are bursting with anticipation to discover the theme of the week (or sometimes two).\n<h2>2. More authentic reading, research, and writing experiences-</h2>\nWhen we read about, wrote about, or watched about a certain topic, students were invested in this topic. They wanted to learn all they could about it and they wanted to share it orally and in writing.\n<h2>3. Opportunities for spiraled practice in a cohesive way-</h2>\nThe great thing about organizing our units within themes, helped students to continue to do all sorts of reading and writing throughout the year, rather than having one trimester of the year all about narrative writing, one quarter about procedural writing, and another all about informational writing. This approach offered real opportunities to practice writing all about the theme, writing a story about the theme (or exploring stories within the theme), answering opinion questions.\n<h2>4. The connections are real-</h2>\nExposing students to informational and narrative text and writing in the same time period surrounding a common theme really helped my students to make meaningful connections. One of my favorite examples was during a \"bat week\" fall unit, students learned all about bats. They wrote bat books... and then we read Night Song (which is such a beautiful story) and their eyes lit up! They had the science vocabulary and knowledge do make real inferences about the text... what was the night song anyway?\n<h2>5. Builds background knowledge-</h2>\nNot only is the gaining of background knowledge amazing for students as young learners, but even just short term within the week, if students are exposed to informational text and opportunities to share, when they write to share an opinion or to make an inference, they are operating with some background knowledge on the topi.\n<h2>6. Facilitates the incorporation of text evidence-</h2>\nEven very young students can do a great job finding text evidence to support their opinions when they've had a chance to engage with text in an authentic way and to draw their own conclusions.\n<h2>7. Keeps skill practice fresh!</h2>\nKids, especially young learners, are acquiring many beginning and foundational skills which require repeated practice. Skills such as sight word practice, math fact practice, number and letter identification can all become tedious and even boring for students. When you can make that small connection between the theme and this practice (yes even just with clip art) it renews their excitement and engagement with basic skill practice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat are some of the other reasons you love thematic units?\n\n&nbsp;",

When I pick units, plan,and teach, there are a few Dos and Don'ts I personally follow.\n\nSome of them I think are inspired from the criticism I've heard of other teachers who were sick and tired of being bound to the same old units. Some of them are just the practical day to day discoveries I have made along the way.\n\nLet's start with the positives!\n<h1>DO:</h1>\n*consider high interest themes\n\n*change your theme for an upcoming week if a particular interest comes up\n\n*search for a way or two to incorporate the theme across subject areas (could you,\u00a0 for example, write a word problem about the theme using the skill that you're focusing on in math?)\n\n*Think of narrative, opinion, and informational prompts and texts pertaining to the unit ahead of time\n\n*Add to units over time to build upon the theme\n\n*Cross check standards to be sure you're covering what's required over time\n\n*Still focus on the district focus for curriculum during reading, writing, and math time.\n\n*Meet district and state standards THROUGH the use of the unit\n\n*Keep a running list of books that you like to use for the unit\n<h1>DON'T</h1>\n*Try to insert thematic unit materials in addition to the regular curriculum (This isn't extra)\n\n*Forgo district goals/ curriculum in order to incorporate thematic unit\n\n*Do an activity just because it has to do with the theme\n\n*Try to gather all themed centers and activities the first year of implementing\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're considering using thematic units, even sometimes,remember that your job as the teacher (and the most fun part of your job) is to use discretion. If it's not fun and engaging for your students or is too much for you, just scale back. Scale back your implementation. Choose just topics your students are interested in and run with those themes!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Thematic-Resources-296767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here are some of my thematic resources.</a>\n\nWhat are some of your favorite thematic units?\n\n&nbsp;",

All of a sudden my planbook would become a mess of smudged pencil marks and scribbles where I had dared to scribble something down in pen. When I sat down at my first team planning meeting with them, there was a big stack of sticky notes on the table. I wondered if we'd use them to mark our place in our planbook, or to earmark important lessons... but we did much more. We filled our planbooks with sticky notes and began to jot down the activities and lessons we'd like to accomplish during the week.\n\nJust like my classroom functioned as a living breathing organism, ever changing and needing to adapt (ok that's a little bit of a weird analogy... but stick with with me here), my planbook was the same way! With my ability to simply switch activities around, move them from day to day, or pull them out and toss them, I was able to evolve my plans for the week without the scribbles!\n\n(Disclaimer here- I use my plan book to jot down ideas and sketch them out. I have an anxiety driven need to type out detailed plans each week, but my planbook is the pacing guide behind the typed plans)\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Untitled-design-61.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1705\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Untitled-design-61.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\nThis whole concept just clicked for me in a big way and I began to apply it to other parts of my day. I began jotting tasks down that needed to be done as the day went on and they popped into my head and I would just \"park them\" onto a chart. Then during plan time I could even schedule them out in order of urgency using my work schedule.\n\nAs a teacher author, I rely heavily on my planning templates! Whenever a new idea pops into my head, it goes right onto a sticky note and is sorted on my chart. At the beginning of each week, I pace out the tasks I'd like to get done each day. This also helps me to vary my tasks so I don't get super bored and burnt out.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Untitled-design-62.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1706\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Untitled-design-62.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\nI've loved using these planning templates so much I just have to share them with you!

I asked for these little stuffed toys for every holiday for years and years of my childhood. Now... over 20 years later I've moved these stinking Beanies from place to place. Classroom to classroom thinking... \"I'll use these someday.\" Push came to shove and I found them just sitting in the bin in the back corner of my classroom for so long. Finally I decided... I needed to use them or they needed to find a new home. After all, I don't want to be like Andy, putting my toys in the attic, I'd rather give them a good home!\n\nSo I got to thinking and planning. Here are 5 fun ways I learned to use my Beanies (and other plush stuffed animals) in the classroom.\n\n1- Buddy Bin- This is really a bin of items that students can bring to and from school. It helps them to make home-school connections. Whether it's like a \"class pet\" that makes its way around the entire class, or something that stays with a student who needs a little extra, this is one great way to use your Beanie Babies or stuffed animals in the classroom!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/helping-hesitant-learners-start-their-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I wrote more about this in my post about helping hesitant learners start their day. Check it out here!</a>\n\n2- Reading Buddy - If your students like partner reading, but sometimes there isn't a buddy available to read with... they can grab a reading buddy. Reading to a Beanie or stuffed animal is loads of fun for kiddos.\n\n3- Research Buddy - This is a really fun way to get students interested in research writing. Whether it's a whole class unit or individual research, having a little buddy go with the topic they're researching can help students have that hands on engagement they're looking for. One cool thing about the Beanie Babies I have is that there are tons of unique animals... bats, spiders, ducks, platypus, anteater, walrus etc. Since my students always loved to learn and write about animals, this was a great way to make the connection!\n\n4- Class Mascot - I used a class mascot when I was teaching first grade and my students LOVED it! The first year I taught first grade it was a little frog puppet that would \"ribbit\" when his mouth moved to sing songs. We named him together and we \"showed\" him our work. I even included him in pictures on our lesson presentations etc. and they just loved it.\n\n5- Beanie Book Bags - When I unboxed my Beanie Babies at home and saw a couple of them that reminded me of characters from some of my favorite stories to share with my class!\u00a0 I sorted these out and placed them with the books. Again this is just another great way to engage your students!\u00a0 (more about this process coming soon!)\n\n&nbsp;",

When testing is over,\u00a0 assessments are largely done, and students are SUPER antsy, it's always fun to use hands on engaging themes to keep them learning and practicing!\n\nOne of my favorite end of the year themes is BUBBLE FUN! I usually have a whole bubble themed day. I bring bubbles in for my students (and TONS of extra, usually in those big jugs) and we get to learning and playing hands on!\n<h1>1.Bubble Wand STEM-</h1>\nI love to talk first all about blowing bubbles and bubble wands.\n\nFirst we talk about what they notice about bubble wands, and then they get to building their very own bubble wand. I've done this activity just offering students pipe cleaners, but I have also offered them a STEM experience with additional materials like wooden craft sticks, string, yarn, paper, cardboard, balloons etc.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Bubble-Activities-Bundle-bundlebonanza-1878121\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1735\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bubble-photo.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"435\" height=\"326\" /></a>\n\nI like to use a KWL chart and observation pages.

I've both given students a recipe, and had them try to create their own bubble solution that worked using glycerin, water, dish soap, baby shampoo etc.\n<h1>3. Bubble Shape Poem</h1>\nI also like to do some bubble fun writing. After the hands on experience I love to make a shape poem. Students are usually full of fun vocabulary and adjectives. You can bubble paint,color,or water color.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Bubble-Activities-Bundle-bundlebonanza-1878121\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1737\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/original-4522897-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"321\" height=\"321\" /></a>\n<h1>4.Narrative Story Writing</h1>\nI also like to launch a narrative story about bubbles this day.It's a great workshop story topic and the students are so excited to write when they have just had so much fun with the same theme.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Bubble-Activities-Bundle-bundlebonanza-1878121\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1738 size-full\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/original-4522897-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>5.Bubble Fun Math</h1>\nA basic roll and color game is a great way to incorporate the bubble theme into your math centers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can get always do these activities on your own, but to use the resources I've create to go along with our bubble day, click here!",

I heard so many early elementary teachers asking how we could ask students to research and basically write reports when they were just learning their letters, sounds, and how to read and write anything.\n\nMy heart and head love a challenge, so when I moved to first grade the following year, I made it one of my missions to figure this out for my students.\n\nWhat I found shouldn't have been surprising.\u00a0 These six year olds LOVED researching. They loved reading and listening and hearing about almost anything. They loved it more than reading about Todd's Mumps or a tabby cat stuck in a tree in the early reader books I had in my classroom.\u00a0 \u00a0They didn't want to write a \"written retell\" but they DID want to write to tell me all about cats, dogs, sharks, snakes, monkeys, bees... just about anything!\n<h2>I tossed around several different methods of informational reading and writing and here are some things I learned:</h2>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Find out what they love- In my experience, most kids love learning about animals. They often would rise to the occasion and get some really great information from texts \"above their level\" when the book was about something interesting.</li>\n \t<li><a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/what-is-a-research-companion/\">Use Research Companions</a> - Having the topic and common organizers and writing pages to guide the research helped to build student independence.</li>\n \t<li>Teach it like you teach most things-\u00a0 model(read and write about something together), practice together (I love to do partner research)\u00a0 and then send them on their own. This is great for writers workshop time or literacy centers. Place a few books and the book companion materials in the center, and they can choose what to read and write about.</li>\n \t<li>Use a checklist- My students became so much more independent when they had a common checklist to follow to help guide them as they were working. I used both a research and a writing checklist.</li>\n \t<li>Give choices- I mentioned this earlier, but I often like to give some choices about what students will research, especially during workshop or center time. Besides the topic, I also like to give them choices for presentation. Some students prefer to have a booklet, others prefer to write more like a paragraph. I also sometimes leave students other fun options, like making shape poems to show what they have learned about a topic. Sometimes this is in addition to a formal written piece, and other times it's not!</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

When I got a little older I had a teacher or two who organized math facts by +1, +2 and +3.\u00a0 The problem with this method is that there are tons of facts to memorize this way. The list felt large, and there were so many strategies that could have made mastering the facts easier to me.\n\nAs a first grade teacher, I found right away that teaching strategies and then connecting those strategies to fact fluency was by far the most effective way for students to master their addition facts. Remember that each set of facts that your students are practicing will require lots of time and practice to internalize to become \"finger snap facts\".\n<h1>Here are a list of the strategies to consider using:</h1>\n<h2>Counting on (+1, +2, and +3)</h2>\nThis is really not a traditional fact fluency tip, because it does involve computation, but often bridges the gap for students and they can learn to do this fairly quickly and efficiently.\nAlso, I've found if you continue to practice counting on as a strategy with that set of facts, students tend to internalize them since they make sense, and are practiced as a smaller set.\n\nAnd when we internalize and are fluent with the facts that are +1, +2, and +3.... look at all the facts we know!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1773\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/math-fact-mastery-by-strategycountingon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"259\" />\n<h2>Doubles</h2>\nDoubles are a super fun set of facts to learn. Once students know them, they can launch right into the next strategy. One year my students practiced a doubles dance. We chanted the facts and make a little movement to go with each set. This really helped them to get up and move and internalize the facts. We started with 2+2 and then added each day as they \"became experts\" at the parts they had learned. Within a week we had our doubles facts under our belts!\n\nAnd here are the facts we master when we've internalized doubles:\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1775\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/math-fact-mastery-by-strategy2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"259\" />\n<h2>Near Doubles</h2>\nOnce my students knew doubles facts, these came much easier! I remember once using a school math program that had learning doubles and near doubles one day after another. I remember thinking... \"How in the world can they actually internalize this strategy when they don't know their doubles yet?\" Knowing their doubles fluently, as well as counting on/ counting back really are prerequisites for this strategy.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1778\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/math-fact-mastery-by-strategy3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"260\" height=\"260\" />\n<h2>Make a 10</h2>\nThis strategy is difficult for some students, but it's also one of the most useful. I always find that 10 frames are the best tool for my students to practice making a 10. Like any other strategy, it starts out as something you practice using the manipulatives, it's clunky. Over time it can be done with pictures, then mental math, and fluency builds after this.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1777\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/math-fact-mastery-by-strategy4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"259\" />\n<h2>Flip Flop Facts (the commutative property)</h2>\nThis strategy is SUPER important because when students know and internalize that 3+4 is the same as 4+3 mathematically, they literally cut the number of facts they need to \"memorize\" in half.\u00a0 In fact I've found that the +1, +2, and +3 are usually the first ones my students master with fluency, doubles and near doubles follow, and if they know the commutative property, there are only 10 problems left to master with the make a 10 strategy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the reason practicing for mastery while learning the strategies, is because when we put all these sets of mastery associated with strategies together... look at what we have!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1776\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/math-fact-mastery-by-strategy5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"324\" height=\"324\" />\n\nNext up, I'll chat more about how I practice these skills in my classroom :-)\n\n&nbsp;",

Holding the classroom community together, fun and engaging activities to keep them learning.\n\nI've written before about how I love to end the year with fun themed days.\n\nWatermelon day is one of my definite favorites. Let's face it, any time we invite our students or kiddos to eat, they're happier.\n\nWhen I plan these themed days, I always like to have some sort of math activity,\u00a0 writing activity, and something related to science or social studies. I also love to find a good read aloud book or two to share with my students.\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f07dba;\">Here are my 5 favorite Watermelon Day activities:</span></h1>\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/disclosures-and-terms/\">(Note: This post contains affiliate links. For full disclosures, click here)</a>\n<h2>WATERMELON OBSERVATIONS</h2>\nThis is their favorite part. I usually start the day with the taste testing and sensory observations. Sometime's I've used a web organizer and other times I've used the sensory web. I also have chosen on certain years to have students extend their web into a writing assignment, but other times, the watermelon web is just fine. This is especially true because I like to do another writing activity or so.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Watermelon-Day-Activities-1956348\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1747\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-85.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"485\" height=\"273\" /></a>\n<h2>Watermelon Opinion Writing-</h2>\nI feel like you definitely want to have the taste testing before moving onto this activity because each year I've had one student at least who has never tried watermelon!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Watermelon-Day-Activities-1956348\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1752\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Copy-of-Copy-of-Untitled-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n<h2>Watermelon Shape Poem-</h2>\nAm I becoming one of those people who says every single activity is their favorites?

I also love that since we use roll and color all year long, they know how to play but the watermelon theme makes it engaging once again! Bump games are another similar type of activity that you can print and laminate and use again and again.

One of the difficult things about teaching math facts by strategy, or even by addend, is that there are few general centers and games which practice them in this way. Usually there are games and activities which focus on mixed fact review, which is a great thing to do once you've gotten a basic handle on facts. The problem is that when all the facts are just introduced in a big slew is that they often feel random and overwhelming for kiddos.\n\nThe best solution I have found is teacher created resources. At first, I found and purchased some resources on <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">teacherspayteachers</a>, and then I started to create my own to meet the unique needs of my students.\n\nI often welcomed and enjoyed groups of students who benefited from tons of differentiation, which is why I established routines which supported differentiation, like a guided math approach. With these groups of students, it became like a mission for me to create games which could meet the vast array of needs of my students.\n<h1>Here are 5 of my favorite types of math fact practice centers, games, and activities to support building math fact fluency.</h1>\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/disclosures-and-terms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Note: this post contains affiliate links.

I can put whichever numbers I'd like on the spinners, and then students can practice the skills at hand.\u00a0 I like to have a recording sheet that can be used with any of the spinners and can be used to practice addition, 3 addends, fact families, and even multiplication.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Color By Code:</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Back-To-School-Color-By-Number-Addition-3296789\"><img class=\"wp-image-1788 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-86.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"494\" height=\"278\" /></a>\n\nThere are tons of reasons I love color by code activities across the board. I used them in many ways in my classroom, and one of those ways is to practice math facts. This is also a great, and quiet, way for students to practice independently. <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Color-by-Code-292862\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I have created color by code resources</a> with doubles and near doubles as a focus as well as mixed fact review, so I can focus on just what my students need. <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Color-by-Code-292862\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I've also created a bunch that are addition to 20</a>, so they can be differentiated with the same picture set.\n<h2>Write the Room</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Write-the-Room-331188\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1790\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-88.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"491\" height=\"276\" /></a>\n\nWrite the room resources are such a fun way to get kids up and moving to practice a number of skills. (Here's a link to a post about how I used them in my classroom). When I first started teaching I would just number index cards and write math facts on them. Now that I've gotten fancier, I've compiled my<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Write-the-Room-331188\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> write the room resources into printable teaching resources</a>. What I love about them is that I can also post a couple of different sets of cards with different borders and have different students go through the center just focusing on different color set of cards that meets their needs.\n<h2>Bump Games-</h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1791\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Copy-of-Untitled-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"427\" height=\"240\" />\n\nI love using bump games in my classroom. I also use roll and color as another take on this activity. In a bump game, students each choose\u00a0 10 counters/ cubes of one color and a partner chooses 10 in a different color. They can either roll or spin to add depending on which method the game set you're using asks for. Then they mark the answer with their cube. If the other player rolls or spins the same sum, they can bump the other players cube off the board. If they have a cube or counter on a spot and then roll or spin the same sum again, they can \"lock\" the space and they can't be bumped off the space. My students always loved the bit of fun competition that takes place during this game, and that there is a winner. I love that I can make my bump games have any set of numbers I'd like to to practice different skills. For example, I created a <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Summer-Math-Center-Counting-on-addition-3888026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">counting on spin and bump game</a> which has two spinners to add. I've also created basic \"roll 2 dice and add\" bump games to practice basic fact fluency.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you'd like to give a hand at creating some of these kinds of resources, you can really personalize for what you'd like. If you'd rather purchase them, you can likely search the type of game and the particular skill you're working on and probably find something that fits your needs!\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/6-games-for-math-fact-fluency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">If you're looking for some great board games you can purchase to practice math fact fluency, check out this post.</a>",

It not only includes practicing coin values, but children must add up their money values and can trade 10 cents for a dime etc. Although this is basic, it's a great way to connect math with money and to even begin to associate coins with place value.\n\n<strong>Skills to practice: Making a 10, Counting on 1,2, and 3, Addition within 10.</strong>\n<h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DWNBLTJ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07DWNBLTJ&linkCode=as2&tag=printablepr09-20&linkId=bee320505ad506dc5f3666701236cca3\">DOS</a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=printablepr09-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B07DWNBLTJ\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /></h3>\n<a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DWNBLTJ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07DWNBLTJ&linkCode=as2&tag=printablepr09-20&linkId=ed4d8c40f84df46c52459273885a043f\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B07DWNBLTJ&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=printablepr09-20\" ></a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=printablepr09-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B07DWNBLTJ\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\nIf you've ever played UNO, you know how much fun it is. It's a definite favorite game for indoor recess. This game, DOS, ups the bar as far as it is related to math fact fluency in the classroom. This version of the game has a few twists and turns, one of them being that instead of matching an exact number, you can put down two numbers that add up to the number you're trying to make. Since children are usually familiar with this game, it's easy to add in the extra rules. You can also really look at this solving as missing addend problems as well (If I need 8 and I have a 3, what other number to do I need to make 8... 3+_=8 or 8-3=_)\n\n<strong>Skills to practice: \"Ways to Make\", Missing addend, addition within 10</strong>\n<h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TLEMRKM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00TLEMRKM&linkCode=as2&tag=printablepr09-20&linkId=68a4871accdbe4f555abbd8391821a01\">Yahtzee</a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=printablepr09-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00TLEMRKM\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /></h3>\n<a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TLEMRKM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00TLEMRKM&linkCode=as2&tag=printablepr09-20&linkId=15b0660965fce8e3a9b7e97b415354c8\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00TLEMRKM&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=printablepr09-20\" ></a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=printablepr09-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00TLEMRKM\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\nThis is a timeless game.

The object of the game is to get as many possible sums as you can for each of the four colors. You have to fill in the sums from left to right (and cant go back) and have to add on your turn as well as your partners turn. There is also an element of looking at different combinations of numbers as well as some strategy. Since the rules are a little tricky at first, I recommend watching a video about how to play (maybe even with your students) to show them how to play. My second grader absolutely loves it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere's a quick video about how to play:\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZAspNiPAUEE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\nHere's the video we watched which helped us learn to play which might be helpful for you as a teacher if you want to make sure you really understand the game before playing (you don't have to watch the whole thing).\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_vOQEcyZ2Q\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Skills to Practice: Addition within 12 (adding 2 dice), ordering and comparing numbers</strong>\n\nIf you're interested in reading more about how I fit math fact practice into the day, check out this post!",

He said \"A swim coach doesn't use the whole practice to have the team stand by the side of the pool and talk about how to swim... the coach gets the team into the water... that's how they get better.\"\n\nI wondered how I could find time to fit new material, math fact practice, and review and skill practice all into the same day.\n<h1>Here are a few of the ways to fit math fact practice into your math block.</h1>\n<h2>Morning Work</h2>\nIf you choose to have students to a morning work assignment when they enter the classroom, this is a great opportunity for repeated skill practice. If you have students practice building fluency with math facts, you will still be able to engage with students as they enter the room and students can often be more independent with these activities. <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/printable-centers-to-practice-addition-and-subtraction-facts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I've used color by code, write the room, and other partner games during this time of day.</a>\n<h2>Morning Meeting Activity</h2>\nI often chose to have some basic math problems on my morning message as a part of our morning meeting. This definitely increased exposure, but we also began to play some other group games which incorporated math facts. We played some clapping games and chanted doubles, we passed a ball and solved a math fact, we played \"I have Who Has?\". This time of the day is designed for community building but other skills, like math facts, can certainly slide their way in.\n<h2>Math Warm Up:</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I've sometimes had a math warm up time. During this time I usually have students use flash cards with facts that relate to the strategy we're focusing on (doubles, counting on to add 1,2, or 3 , making 10 etc). We've also used <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/reasons-to-love-write-the-room-practice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">write the room activities</a> as a math warm up, especially when we transition back from lunch or special during math time.\n\n</p>\n\n<h2>Math Centers</h2>\nI quickly learned that choosing to format my math block using a guided math approach worked best for me and my students. Each day I would have three centers students would rotate through ( 15 minute mini lesson and 3 15 minute rotations). One of the centers each day focused on math fact fluency. Whether they were playing\u00a0 a <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/6-games-for-math-fact-fluency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">store bought game</a>,<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/printable-centers-to-practice-addition-and-subtraction-facts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> printable game or activity</a>, or even a math fact game or app, they were practicing math facts during this time, usually in a way also related to the strategy we were practicing.\n<h2>Math Cool Down</h2>\nJust like your math warm up, you could have a math fact cool down activity. Whether as a class, in partners, or in a basic printable paper and pencil way, your students can get that practice in at the end of the math block.\n<h2>Homework:</h2>\nI decided 2 years into teaching after reading tons and tons about how research pointed to how useless our homework packets were, that my only homework would be reading and math fact practice. I sent home math games, and you could even send home a little math buddy bag to give students games and materials that they could use to play basic math games.\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "After working hard to teach math strategies, practicing facts with centers and activities, and games, and doing so on a regular basis, you've got to assess. I know... it's like its own dirty word. It's usually not a ton of fun, but there are a few different ways to assess math fact practice that I'll share here. I welcome you to share more ways in the comments since it's always great to have a variety! Before you start, be sure to check with your district to see what they consider to be mastering fluency. Typically the reading I have done leads me to the guideline that 20 facts per minute is considered fluency.\n<h2>1.Paper and Pencil Test</h2>\nWhether you're testing by strategy, you can do the minute long paper and pencil math fact tests to see if students can quickly solve the equations and then track their progress. Some students get really stressed by this, and assessing this way isn't a lot of fun, but my students actually often looked forward to it. I have created <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Addition-to-20-Fact-Fluency-Check-Ups-4239886\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">addition</a> and<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Subtraction-Within-20-Fact-Checkups-4337473\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> subtraction</a> printable quick check ups that you can use to help you assess by addend and subtrahend. I always like to keep in mind that for some students, you won't catch the fluency this way, especially in young children. AND just because you're measuring time, doesn't mean they need to know that. You can definitely just give them a window of time to work and then make your own observations about time.\n<h2>2. Math Program or App-</h2>\nOne of the math programs I used in my third grade classroom was\u00a0<a href=\"https://xtramath.org/#/home/index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">XtraMath</a>. Some of my first graders also used the program, however, it was important to remember that some of them had difficulty finding the numbers on the keyboard, which also impeded finding how well they truly were able to add. For some students sites like this one helped to measure and practice moving toward math fact fluency.\n<h2>3. Flash Card Check Up-</h2>\nI often had students complete this with a partner. We use a basic checklist for math skills and then students use the matching flashcards to assess one another, or I use flashcards to help them. Timing them in this way helps me to also notice which strategies they are still reaching for instead of having really learned the facts in a snap, and it helps me to focus future practice in a differentiated way. The downside to this approach is that it takes more time to sit 1:1 with students.\n<h2>4.Informal Observations-</h2>\nI think the most effective way to bring all of these parts together and to answer the question \"is my student fluent\" is through informal observations. You can see during math centers, activities, and tests how students are developing with their fluency.\u00a0 I like to use this basic four point rubric to kind of keep in mind how they are doing when they work. If I do some of the assessment as a quick fact warm up when they are in small group with me, these observations are much easier to manage making. I see which students are still using counting on as a strategy. I look to see which problems are taking the longest and which they are struggling with most. This really informs my instruction and helps me decide which kind of <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/printable-centers-to-practice-addition-and-subtraction-facts/\">center fact practice</a> to include in the future to help them further build fluency.\n\nIf you have any other fun ways to practice math fact mastery, please feel free to share below!",

When I first started teaching, I went with the team and sent home nightly homework that was associated with the math program we were using, and helped students to review/ practice the skill of the day. There was a huge pressure for students to be independent after just the first day, and it caused more stress than anything else.\n\nIt was soon after this that I began to read about how ineffective this type of homework is. In fact, the most meaningful homework assignments, I believe, are more related to fluency. They require repeated practice and familiar routines.\n\nWhen I asked families to read with their children as a method of encouraging literacy and building reading fluency, they knew what to do.... but when I asked many families to practice math facts, they asked for worksheets, or websites where they could find worksheets. Don't get me wrong, there are some worksheets that can support building math fluency, such as color by code pages, but the whole idea of scrapping the homework thing was that students would be able to have more time to be kids and play. I wanted them to engage with their family and environment when they got home.\n\nHere's one way I found to help solve the problem!\n\nI created little Math Buddy Bags to send home.\n\nThese bags have general materials to use to play basic games to build fact fluency! Many of the items can be purchased, or you can just print and make your own to save a little!\n\nThe students bring these bags home, along with a few game ideas (I usually type them up on half sheets or quarter sheets so they fit right into the bag).\u00a0 They have the materials they need in their bags to practice math facts and play some basic games.\n<h1>How to Build a Math Buddy Bag</h1>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1840\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190602_153558.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"407\" height=\"305\" />\n\n*This part of the post includes affiliate links.

I wanted to know what I could give my students at the fundamental, basic levels of conceptual math instruction that could grow with them as they got into more difficult and complex math problems as they got older.\n\nI began to wonder... what if we just practiced word problems as a part of our math routine each day?\n\nI began to develop and introduce my students to problem solving journals. At first, I focused on skills, like Place Value and Subtraction, which matched the unit we were studying during math. This practice REALLY helped them to internalize and make sense of some of these concepts, but I was still dealing with the issue of retention... and that is when my monthly word problem journals with spiraled review were born.\n<h1>Reasons I love spiral Math Word Problem journals:</h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Math-Word-Problem-Journals-305030\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1885\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Untitled-design-47.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Seasonal content is relevant.

Students grew with math independence, retained content knowledge, and became more confident in taking on problems that they may not immediately know how to solve.\n\nI currently have created September through May in monthly math journals and then a summertime journal for students which are all designed to meet first grade math standards.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Monthly-Word-Problems-First-Grade-Journal-Bundle-3825568\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://ecdn.teacherspayteachers.com/thumbitem/First-Grade-Monthly-Math-Journals-Spiraled-Word-Problem-Practice-3825568-1554650205/original-3825568-1.jpg\" alt=\"Monthly Word Problems First Grade Journal Bundle\" /></a>\n\nI also designed a kindergarten number math journal which is great for kindergartners here!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Numbers-to-10-Kindergarten-Math-Journal-3368787\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://ecdn.teacherspayteachers.com/thumbitem/Kindergarten-Math-Journal-Numbers-to-10-3368787-1554651378/original-3368787-1.jpg\" alt=\"Numbers to 10 Kindergarten Math Journal\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a>\n<h1><a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/my-math-problem-solving-routine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">For more about my math problem solving journal routine- click here!</a></h1>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

This means that we would work on problems with a number of different math topics, so they couldn't just call automatically on whatever skill is in your focus unit, but instead have to really pull from their overall math understanding.\n\nHere's how I went about introducing and helping my students to become more independent with problem solving with word problems.\n<h2>1.Practice the first few days together:</h2>\nI was able to upload the PDF file to SMART NOTEBOOK which is what my district used and then I was able to write over it. You could also print them in a larger size.\u00a0 I practiced reading and thinking aloud together with my students. I modeled identifying words that helped me to figure out which information I needed and how to work through the problem by following the steps.\n<h2>2. Gradual release:</h2>\nWhile I don't always think gradual release is the most effective way to stretch our students, when I am developing a routine I'd like for them to be independent with, helping to wean them toward that independence is worth the investment. I started by having them practice reading the problem and drawing a picture together. Then we would discuss/ share those representations and write the equation together.\u00a0 Eventually they were ready for independent practice.\n<h2>3.Productive struggle:</h2>\nWhen we moved toward independence, I really left these problems up to them as math problem solvers. If I had a student who wasn't reading at all, I might go over and whisper read the problem to them after they tried to pick out some important keywords. Then I let them go on their own. Draw their own picture, write an equation, fill in the answer sentence.\n\nThe perks of watching that productive struggle were many. I was able to throw them into problem solving situations to see what strategies they employed naturally through their own thinking process. Then, if any students needed any coaching I could do that through student work samples, or through 1:1 coaching.\n<h1>4. Feedback-</h1>\nThis comes in a few different forms. As I mentioned sometimes I would display two student papers using our document cam anonymously. I ask \"What do you notice\" and \"What are you wondering\". This helped the students to really become reflective about their own representations of the problem and strategies to solve. Then students are often ready to self correct. Sometimes I just asked students to raise their hands when they had completed all the parts of the problem and I'd go around with a sticker or stamp to add to their \"I Did It!\" box.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile there were often school days off, assemblies or special events that limited our ability to problem solve absolutely EVERY day, we would try to use these spiraled word problem practice journals at least 15 days a month.\u00a0 This is in addition to whatever practice we're doing relating to our current topic of study.\n\nI did try out using these during math centers, but I found that this was really most effective at the end of the month if we had some problems to finish up, and since the feedback was not immediate I found it to be less effective than when we all spent 10 minutes at the end of the math block problem solving.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Math-Word-Problem-Journals-305030\">If you're interested in checking out my problem solving journals, CLICK HERE</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Math-Word-Problem-Journals-305030\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1885\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Untitled-design-47.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/5-reasons-to-love-spiraled-math-word-problem-practice/\">To read more about why I love spiraled math review, check out this post!</a>\n\n&nbsp;",

I'm guessing we pretty much all agree on that.\n\nBut during my time substituting at the beginning of my teaching career,\u00a0 I began to notice another job with its own unique challenges... paraprofessionals. In fact, my days substituting for paras were some of the most demanding and exhausting of my entire teaching career.\n\nAs I moved along in my teaching journey, there was something else I began to notice...there seemed to be a level of tension among / between paras and teachers. It was hard to put my finger on, but I could tell something was wrong.\n\nIt was casual eye rolls. It was small passive aggressive comments made during passing. I heard frustration from teachers or paras who both seemed to be kind of frustrated about the same issues. (unclear expectations, little to no feedback/direction, overbearing, making each others jobs harder etc).\n\nWhen I got my first teaching position,\u00a0 I had the amazing opportunity to have a paraprofessional assigned to my classroom on a daily basis. In the following few years, this trend continued as I had many students who received special education services (and boy was I glad to have the push in support available). Year after year, I began to ask the paras I worked closely with what their biggest gripes were, and I even asked tough questions about our own relationships. As I navigated this space, here are the 5 things that helped my classroom paraprofessionals and I to have a positive and productive year.\n<h2>COMMUNICATE EXPECTATIONS-</h2>\nIf I was looking to save the biggest idea for last, this would be it. I know that you're probably busy and if this is the only point you read, I want you to read it loud and clear.\u00a0 It seems so simple, right?\u00a0 Of course we know that communication is key, but what does this mean in terms of the classroom environment? Does it mean hand the para a list of rules on the first day? (....I have friends who this has happened to)...probably not. What it can mean is a scheduled chat early on in the year about the roles you can both play in the classroom.\u00a0 It worked out best for me to do this after learning a little bit about my paras.\u00a0 I worked with an amazing woman one year who had a strong background and experience in early literacy. For my first graders, this was AMAZING! I asked questions about what she most enjoyed etc. and we sorted out roles for different times of the day. This was very much a give and take conversation \"What do you think about working with -student a- on their sight word objective first thing when they arrive?\" This helped to prevent either one of us from thinking the other had less of a work load, or was doing something counterproductive.\n<h2>LEARN TOGETHER-</h2>\nUnfortunately, one thing I learned early on is that in general, paraprofessionals are not offered the same professional development opportunities. For this reason, I always made an effort to share the things I learned with my classroom assistants when I returned.\u00a0 Then I'd share a plan to try some of the learning out and we'd see how it went... together.\n<h2>PLAN TOGETHER-</h2>\nThis one really closely connects to the first tip, but planning together can help set day to day expectations and will give an opportunity for new ideas to enter the playing field!\n<h2>Acknowledge-</h2>\nAs you already know, paraprofessionals are adult humans. They are people who want to be seen and heard.\u00a0 Whether it's a small gesture of kindness,\u00a0 a sincere \"thank you\" or \"good job\" ... or even a respectful interaction with parents, knowing that they are valued and appreciated is so valuable! After all, sometimes the teachers get the accolades for student achievement, and the support staff gets left behind, so be sure to go out of your way to share the praise.\n<h2>PARAS ARE TEACHERS TOO-</h2>\nSay it with me... Paras are teachers.\u00a0 Remember this during your discussions about students, during the lessons they teach... regardless of their backgrounds they are teachers. In fact, they are often the teachers spending the most time with our students requiring the highest levels of support. Respect them, listen to them, and appreciate them.\n\n&nbsp;",

My first graders loved researching and writing as a class, in partners, and even on their own as part of a research writing center.\n\nThe farm is always a fun kindergarten and first grade unit, and it even makes a great field trip if you have a local farm. With the help of <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/research-and-report-writing-in-the-elementary-classroom/\">research companion materials</a>, your students can organize and plan their writing. I even created a farm animal specific research companion to use with my students, and I've shared it in my store if you'd like to share it with yours.\n\nAs with all of my research companions, I knew my students needed differentiated texts, and sometimes even video notetaking was our focus objective. For that reason, I compiled graphic organizers, writing pages, and literacy extension activities to support research using whatever books and videos best meet the needs of your students.\n\nI know that it can be tricky to pull all those resources together time and time again, so here's a list of farm animal resources that would pair well with a farm research unit! \n\n<em>This post contains affiliate links.

    "content": "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1956\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Copy-of-Copy-of-penguin-page-photo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"576\" height=\"384\" />\n\nWhen I was teaching first grade, I often got the question from kindergarten and even PreK teachers asking \"What can we do to prepare students for learning to read?\"\u00a0 I always felt like I was walking a thin line when it came to this discussion because what I did NOT want to encourage was pressuring students, stressing them out, and making reading hard because it was being pushed earlier than they were ready for.\u00a0 As a mom of three kiddos, I also knew that there were some really easy thing that could be done very naturally and appropriately to help children develop a love of reading while also encouraging and exposing them to early literacy skills.\n\nHere are a few things you could toss into your literacy routines with preschoolers (or even toddlers) to get them ready for reading.\n<h1>Read to them. Every single day.</h1>\nThis tip is probably the most common one given. If we encourage a love of reading by making it a warm, shared, and fun experience, children will know about all the amazing stories and information books can hold.\u00a0 This can also help children to identify as readers.\n<h1>Put books in their hands</h1>\nWhether you give children access to many books to choose from, or invite them to hold the book you're reading together, just watching and practicing holding books helps children to begin to develop their awareness of concepts about print. They'll learn how to hold a book properly, turn pages, and enjoy the story! While they can and will observe you using these skills when you read, they need lots of practice with books to do this on their own.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1958\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Copy-of-penguin-page-photo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"576\" height=\"384\" />\n<h1>Point to the words.</h1>\nWhen you're reading a book with just a few words (board books and early readers are great for this) point to the words. You can also point to important words as you read. Just watching you do this practice begins to help children understand that the words help tell the story.\n<h1>Practice left-right Directionality</h1>\nConnecting lines or images, sliding or moving your finger from left to right under the text is\u00a0 a great way to help children notice the left-right directionality used when we read and write in English.\n<h1>Read Patterned/ Predictable text:</h1>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1959\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Copy-of-Unicorn-page-photo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"576\" height=\"384\" />\n\nYou don't have to ALWAYS read these kind of basic patterned stories, but exposing children to predictable text helps them to begin to use reading strategies, like using the picture to predict how the pattern will change.\n<h1>Read books again and again</h1>\nRemember that children often don't tire of stories like grown ups do. They like to read \"again\" and \"again\" and so many of these skills can be inserted each time as you read so your children can begin to become experts about the book. They are ready to point to the pictures and words, name and notice the characters and even begin to \"read\" the story on their own!\n\nOne of my favorite ways to practice some of these early literacy skills are through interactive read alouds. I have begun creating a few for my own kiddo as she practices basic concepts. You can check them out in my TPT shop here:\n<h1>Engaging in natural discussion</h1>\nTalk about what's happening in the story. Ask the child to point to the page to show you things (I Noticed the flower in this page. Do you see the flower?) React\u00a0 to the story (\"oh no! Look what happened!). This is like a \"think aloud\" and helps children to understand what you're thinking as you read. You can also begin to ask some basic questions about the text, but I always like to avoid quizzing students at this age... or any age really. Genuine discussion helps you to model and learn a lot more about their understanding of the text. If you're interested in some of my suggestions for questioning really young readers, I've written more about that here.\n<h1>Make Reading Interactive:</h1>\nI love books that have moving pieces and parts. Whether it's a lift the flap type book, or a book that has some sort of task. While we have a few favorites, I have started making some that reinforce the concepts that my own little one is learning, like colors, feelings, and vocabulary.\u00a0 I've shown photos from a few of these printable resources in this post, and you can check them out here!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Unicorn-Emergent-Reader-4790704\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1950\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Untitled-design-48.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"576\" height=\"384\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "You may be wondering how you can support early literacy with PreK students, or even younger! I've written before about many little things you can do to support early literacy,\u00a0 but today I want to share with you some of the ways I've asked natural questions to help engage young children, rather than quiz them as we read.\n\nThere are a few different kinds of questions you can take the time to ask as you read.\n<h1>Ask Questions With Answers You Can Point to:</h1>\nAsk children to find things on the page like \"Oh look! I see a ____! Do you see it?\" You can also open this up to children to be more child guided by asking \"What do you notice on this page?\" This kind of questioning makes reading more interactive for children and also helps them to begin to learn that you can find information and evidence in books. Depending on the questions you're asking, you can also help to increase vocabulary and concept awareness (shapes, numbers, colors etc).\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>Ask questions that have no wrong answer:</h1>\nLow pressure questions help children to enjoy the book, they can turn to a page to show you (the prerequisite for finding text evidence that will be so important in years to come), and they can't be wrong. A favorite is a favorite!\n\n\"Which page did you like best? \"\n\"Which part was your favorite?\"\n<h1>Ask Story Element Questions</h1>\nAvoid quizzing the children, but instead encourage discussion as you read.\n\nAsk children questions like these naturally:\n\nCharacters: \"Who is here?\" or \"Who is on this page?\"\u00a0 or\u00a0\"How does _____ feel?\"\n\nSetting: \"Where are they?\" \"Can you see the house?\" \"Where are they going?\"\n\nProblem: \"Uh oh! What happened?\"\n\nSolution: \"Oh wow! What happened now?\"\n\nWhen I'm trying to teach a more formal lesson, I like to use question cards with common visuals and question prompts. <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/reading-comprehension-building-independence-in-beginning-readers/\">You can find more about my favorite way to do and to build independence with early readers here:</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Reading-Comprehension-Question-Prompts-4293945\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1953\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/original-4293945-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

It is so much fun to watch their eyes widen as they begin to see the possibility that exists in the world.It's pretty inspirational!\n\nUsing picture books as a way to introduce biographical stories of great adventures and achievements is also a great way to introduce young students in an appropriate way to some of the political and cultural issues that are a part of our history ( and sometimes present).\n\nRecently , I received a few copies of books from Innovation Press for review. The thing that I loved about these titles is that they all have determined, strong, and inspirational women at the forefront of the books.

When a child finds a series that they love and can relate to, it takes that friction out of choosing a good book to snuggle up with. I know my own children, as they transitioned to chapter books, choosing a book they don't love seems like such a big investment compared to flying through a picture book that maybe isn't your favorite.\n\nI recently received a couple of copies of books from the Zoey and Sassafras series by Asia Citro from Innovation press for review, and I LOVE them!\n\n<em>This post contains affiliate links as part of the Amazon Associates program, which means that I earn a small commission from purchases made through these links at no additional cost to you. </em>\n\nHere are some of the reasons I think they're amazing:\n<h2><strong>1. The reading level is perfect for beginning chapter book lovers.</strong></h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.zoeyandsassafras.com/thebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to the book website</a>, the book levels range from N-P which is solid second and third grade reading, but I know some first graders who would love and be able to read the books.\n<h2><strong>2. These books are an amazing mix of science and fantasy.</strong></h2>\nThe author does such a great job of connecting real science topics and concepts along with the playful and imaginative storylines with unicorns, merhorses, and talking frogs (to name a few).\n<h2><strong>3. Vocabulary sprinkled throughout</strong></h2>\nAlthough some of the text structure is more basic, causing it to be accessible to a wide range of readers, there is still some great vocabulary sprinkled throughout the book. I love to include vocabulary connections in my study of books, and this one lends itself to that!\n<h2><strong>4. Engaging pictures makes the stories inviting.</strong></h2>\nI love the black and white pictures sprinkled throughout and so do my kiddos. It helps to bring the story to life, but still leaves plenty of room for imagination.\n<h2><strong>5. Generally short chapter length and larger than usual printed words</strong></h2>\nThis has been really important for some of my struggling readers. Long chapters are daunting and seem to lose students in frustration. The shorter chapters allow for time to stop, check comprehension, discuss and reflect in a more natural way.\n\nCheck out the books in the series so far!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1943147094/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1943147094&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=printablepr07-20&amp;linkId=b9b8051adfb6433a931e79abfd01872b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=1943147094&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=printablepr07-20\" border=\"0\" /></a><img style=\"border: none !important;

Consider the type of activities you're leaving,\n<h2>2. Your substitute probably doesn't know your routines.</h2>\nIt's not a bad idea to type up a set of general routines to leave in a substitute binder. It's so much easier to be prepared for a class as a sub when they know how the students line up, procedures for using the bathroom, etc.\u00a0 Of course you wouldn't want to expect the sub to follow every routine perfectly since he/she will also be generally managing the class, but it's a great resource to have in case the substitute has any questions and can make the day go much more smoothly.\n<h2>3.\u00a0 Leave an <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/things-to-include-in-your-substitute-binder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emergency substitute binder</a></h2>\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/things-to-include-in-your-substitute-binder/\">I've written a whole blog post about this because it was that helpful to me</a>. You can put your routines right into the binder, but don't forget to include information about fire drills, or other emergency drills your school has procedures for.\u00a0 You can also leave a full set of emergency substitute plans inside in case you have to be out unexpectedly. Copies are made, and you can lay at home in bed and rest knowing that there are plans for your students.\n<h2>4. Leave models and objectives for all activities-</h2>\nWhen you leave a model of an activity and a couple extra copies it gives your substitute a chance to see what you were intending for the students to do during the time. The extra copies also give the sub a chance to model the assignment for the class, especially if it's something that requires many steps.\n<h2>5. Disrupt the schedule as little as possible-</h2>\nI have substituted in many classrooms where a teacher wanted the job for the sub to be so easy that he/she just left one thick worksheet packet after another for students to complete. These have also been some of my hardest substitute assignments. Students become bored, they become fidgety, they are looking for that routine. While it may not always make sense to move onto the next lesson in math, or to continue a complicated reading group, just keeping some of those routines moving can really help with classroom management. As an example, my students used to begin the day with writing, and then readers workshop and literacy centers.\u00a0 Even if I did not introduce a brand new goal/ objective during writing time, I would still have the substitute do a read aloud, and give children time to write and then share. Keeping this momentum going makes them feel comfortable and also makes it more likely that they'll also follow those routine behavior expectations.\n\nThat being said.... let's move on to #6\n<h2>6. Leave some extras.</h2>\nThink about some quick and easy activities your substitute could have in her back pocket in case an activity takes a much shorter time than usual. The substitute also may not know what the usual quality of work for your students is, and sometimes I've had students just rush and do what we call a \"hurry up job\" on their work.\u00a0 Things like color by code, sorting activities, or even an extra quick and easy read aloud with a book activity.\n<h2>7. Manage your expectations-</h2>\nI never expected that everything would be done perfectly. I was flexible if things came up, or students didn't complete the work. Remember that your substitute is probably doing the very best that he/she can and is trying to get through a somewhat productive day without knowing your students very well. Give them grace.\n\n&nbsp;",

It's time to put in for a sick day.... but is everything all set and ready to go at school? Will the day go smoothly? Should you try to drag yourself in to make sure everything is in its place?\n\nIn my case, my son has asthma. Sometimes his asthma attacks come on without notice and result in ambulance rides across the state to a children's hospital. Usually I tried to print enough information in my daily plans, but I realized that there was so much information missing that I wished I could have just told the substitute to help make the day go more smoothly.\u00a0 I knew that my substitute didn't need ALL the background and information, but certain routines and procedures would have been super helpful for her.\n\nAs soon as I returned to work, I got busy compiling a substitute binder.\n\nHere are the things I included in my binder for the elementary level (and a few more I'll add when I return to teaching full time from my substitute status.)\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f88a6dc4-34bb-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/substitute-binder-templates-editable\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2076\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-penguin-page-photo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" /></a>\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Student List</strong>- Leaving a list of your student names can help the substitute know who is supposed to be in your classroom.\u00a0 I liked to leave a checklist sort of format so the substitute could jot down notes (like if a student left the room for services etc)</li>\n \t<li><strong>Safety procedures</strong>- Check with your school. There is probably some sort of generic information you are supposed to leave. It's not a bad idea to leave comments about how you handle these within your classroom.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Adult contacts</strong>- It's so helpful to leave a contact or two the teacher should go to if they have questions, as well as the extension for the nurse, secretary, principal etc.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Class Schedule</strong>- Including a schedule for the day, including any special classes, is a very helpful overview and will definitely also help if your substitute needs to use your emergency plans.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Services Schedule</strong>- If you have any students who receive special services, it is helpful for a substitute to have access to this information for safety reasons. If he/ she doesn't know where a student is expected to go, it can cause confusion. It's especially helpful to comment on whether an adult will call for or come to get the student, or if the student is expected to report to the adult's room independently.</li>\n \t<li>\u00a0<strong>Basic classroom routines</strong>- Include information about how the teacher should take attendance and if they'll need to access any login type programs throughout the day. also consider: What do student do when they come into the classroom? Are there any special transitions you use with your students? Is there a procedure if they need assistance with a student?</li>\n \t<li><strong>Classroom Accommodations</strong>- Consider leaving information that will set your students up for success, particularly if the substitute is expected to follow certain protocols or provide certain accommodations. If, for example, a student benefits from sitting in a chair rather than on the floor for lessons, knowing this information can help prevent issues.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Pertinent Medical Considerations</strong>-\u00a0 If there are any medical issues that will require the substitute to monitor behavior etc. leave these accommodations. In fact, if a student has a medical plan, it's a good idea to check with the nurse/ parents to get their input about information left for substitutes.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Emergency Plans</strong>- This is a biggie. I have found it super useful to type up one day worth of plans that a substitute could use regardless of what day it is. Depending on how your schedule fluctuates you could either leave variations of the schedule using the same activities for different days, or you could leave plans based on subject and ask the substitute to refer to the schedule portion of your binder. For example, you could leave plans for reading time, math time, etc.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Feedback form</strong>- Consider leaving a way for the substitute to leave you feedback.

    "title": "Ways to Teach Collecting Evidence to Support a Claim",
    "content": "&nbsp;\n\nCollecting evidence to support claims can be one of the most difficult things to get students to do, and it's even harder sometimes to get them to write about it.\u00a0 Many times they just \"know it\" because they \"know it\". Asking them to dig into the text doesn't always come naturally. To throw a rock in the chain here, each book is different, different genres work differently, and then there are typically many different claims which could ALL be supported by the text.\u00a0 I had some students who thrived on the generic graphic organizer to written page approach, but some students were needing something more. Here are some of the ways I taught and practiced collecting evidence to support a claim with my students in both first and third grade.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/f4de0b458c34/collectingevidence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1.Generic Graphic Organizer-</a></h2>\nUsing a general boxes and bullets sort of organizer for collecting evidence is a great way to help students to organize their ideas. I think it is one of my favorite ways to get them ready to write because it lends itself to supporting an organized writing piece so well.\n<h2>2.Sticky Note Evidence Hunt-</h2>\nAny time I bring sticky notes into my classroom, whether for identifying story parts,\u00a0 retelling, or engaging in reading discussions. (I've written more about this here). However in terms of finding evidence, there are a couple ways I have done this. If you're working with a whole group book ro read aloud, you can give each student a sticky note. Have them generate either a claim, or evidence for a claim during a whole group or partner lesson.\u00a0 Then share it and stick it onto the chart paper. This is also a great jumping off point if you're planning to go onto a graphic organizer and writing activity.\n\nIf you're working with independent reading or reading groups, students can jot on sticky notes to collect evidence as they read.\n<h2>3. Catch My Evidence-</h2>\nThis was one of my students' favorite type of activities from first grade to third. They would generate a claim (Something that is true based on the text). Usually they would do this in partners or small group. Then, they write their claim on the top of a graphic organizer. Then, they swap papers with a group and the teams have to find evidence for each others claims!\n<h2>4. Evidence Board Gallery Walk-</h2>\nThis is kind of a fun way to work through collecting evidence for books in a way that also keeps students engaged and moving. There are a couple ways to implement this activity, and it really depends on your student level, need for support, and the amount of time you'd like to invest in the activity.\u00a0 I love this method because it requires students to collect the evidence when they create the claim (one of their jobs is to make sure there will be evidence for the other teams to find), and then investigate and support the claims of others. You can have students respond to a whole group text, or you can have them each respond to short read aloud books that other groups have done, and have a copy of the text at each station (a more complete post about this activity is coming soon!).\n\n<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/f4de0b458c34/collectingevidence\">If\u00a0 you'd like to get a free digital copy of a graphic organizer you can use with your students, click here to subscribe!</a>\n\n&nbsp;",

I think they're super engaging, and holidays are a perfect time for thematic resources!\n\nThis year I've been working on creating resources for younger students at the preschool and kindergarten level.\n\nI thought maybe you'd like to try some of these activities for the young kiddos in your life whether they're your children or students you're working with.\n\nHere are some Valentine's day activities to practice number 1-5.\n<h1>Clip Cards</h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f4e74a9a-512e-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/heart-themed-number-practice-1-5\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2132\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Untitled-design-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nClip cards are one of my favorite ways to practice a number of beginning skills, mostly because they grow to be a more independent activity.\u00a0 They also provide a common routine, but you can change the content in order to practice different skills. I also love that there is such a component of fine motor skills and hand eye coordination.\u00a0 This set includes matching numbers to numbers, numbers to quantities, and quantities to numbers.\n\nSpinner Game\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f4e74a9a-512e-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/heart-themed-number-practice-1-5\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2133\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Untitled-design-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\nIf you have followed any of my elementary math resources, you know how much I love spinner games. I am a huge fan of using routines and switching out content (just like with the clip cards) and spinners allow for this, but also for differentiation! For this resource, I have included two spinners so that one requires children to match the number on the spinner to the recording sheet, and the other one requires matching the quantity to the number, so you can choose the version just right for the child or children you're working with!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Number Journal</h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f4e74a9a-512e-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/heart-themed-number-practice-1-5\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2134\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Untitled-design-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy little one is three now and she just LOVES having \"homework\" to do just like her brothers. She's also dying to write. I printed this math journal 2 sided and stapled it so she had her own little number booklet.\u00a0 There are three activities for each number: Count and color, show the number (either by drawing or cutting and pasting), and then a find and color where they match the actual numeral.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Number Posters:</h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f4e74a9a-512e-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/heart-themed-number-practice-1-5\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2135\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Untitled-design-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>While these posters alone aren't really an activity, there is so much you can do with them! You can display them for number awareness, you can practice\u00a0 counting to identify numbers, and they can also be used as mats for different number activities. For example, you could print them and have a child put one dough ball on the 1 card, 2 on 2 and so on.\u00a0 You could also print these 2 or 4 to a page and print a few different copies to play a memory game.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe also did this cut and paste activity, which just requires some paper, a marker, and some cutout hearts (this is where my Cricut machine came in<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f4e74a9a-512e-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/heart-themed-number-practice-1-5\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2136\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Untitled-design-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a> super handy!)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're looking for something a little more advanced for number practice, this Valentine's Day Color by Number resource might be just what you're looking for!\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/b1ffae2e-5134-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/valentines-day-color-by-number\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2138\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/original-3458331-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a>",

Differentiation can be quite a challenge, especially with the time constraints and classroom management challenges that come with teaching early elementary students.\n\nI absolutely LOVE using a center or station based approach for both reading and math. A center based approach, even for some of the math block helped me to differentiate and meet with students in small groups where they'd have 15 minutes or so of \"just right\" instruction and then skill practice and independent practice during the rest of the block.\n\nThe biggest challenge is giving directions, especially if I am the only adult in the classroom. My first graders had such a hard time remembering what each center entailed, and if I was to make good use of my time with the students at my instructional center, of course I couldn't really be continuously interrupted to help another group get started.\n\nThe way I found to hop over this hurdle is to use a set of different games and activities that I could basically use to practice many different skills, but would require students to use the same routine, so they'd know just what to do <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/5-favorite-math-manipulatives-for-first-grade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(and use right alongside with some of my favorite math manipulatives)</a>\n\n<em>This post contains affiliate links.

Additionally you could have a spinner with word families and children write down words that have the same word family ending.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Roll/ Spin and Cover:</h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Counting-on-Addition-Strategy-3923556\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2164 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Valentines-Day-Number-Practice-For-Preschool-Kindergarten-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\nJust like the spin and record, the spinners hold the key to many different skills that can be practiced. This game requires a recording sheet where students will find and mark or color the answer or match. The great thing about this game is that it can be done independently or with a partner.\n\nFor example: You could spin a capital letter and the children have to match to the lowercase match on their recording sheet.\u00a0 Children could also spin two times and then add, multiply, build numbers, or even practice recording fact families.\n<h1>Bump Games:</h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Turkey-Word-Work-Game-3178586\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2161 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Valentines-Day-Number-Practice-For-Preschool-Kindergarten-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\nThis game is sort of like the \"level 2\" partner version of a roll and cover game. Whether you're practicing math facts, identifying sight words, or even phonics skills, bump games follow the same basic format. Students either roll, spin, or choose a card and then mark\u00a0 on a game mat. They take turns with a partner. If their partner gets the same option as them, they can bump the first player's piece away and replace it with their own. If you get a solution that you already have one playing piece on, you get to place a second piece on top to \"lock the spot\" so you can't be bumped.\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Write-the-Room-331188\">Write the Room:</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Write-the-Room-331188\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2163\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Valentines-Day-Number-Practice-For-Preschool-Kindergarten-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\nThere are tons of reasons I love Write the Room Practice and one of them is that it's a common routine that children get used to. They know to grab a clip board, pencil, and move around the room responsibly to complete their task.\n\nThe write the room cards around the room can have numbers, equations, shapes, colors, words, sentences, or even reading comprehension questions. The options are endless! I loved using a common recording sheet with common images students were used to finding, but it's also super fun to mix things up at different holiday time!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Color-by-Code-292862\">Color By Code:</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Color-by-Code-292862\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2159 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Valentines-Day-Number-Practice-For-Preschool-Kindergarten.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\nI've also written about why I love this sort of practice so much. These are engaging for students, can be used to practice math skills or word study skills and they can be used during many different times of day. It's fun to have different seasonal images, and you can choose different ones for different groups of students in order to differentiate while everyone is still working on the same type of activity.\n\nMatching Game:\nThe fun thing about matching games is that they can be used to practice basic skills such as matching letters, colors, or numbers. Matching games can also be used to identify factors, solve equations, match number models, or even practice algebraic skills.\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Clip-Cards-304895\">Clip Cards:</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Printableprompts/Category/Clip-Cards-304895\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2160 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-Valentines-Day-Number-Practice-For-Preschool-Kindergarten-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\nClip cards are great for hands on practice of skills, whether counting, reading, vocabulary, or even punctuation. The opportunities are endless. These cards basically have a question or prompt and then multiple choice where students can use clothespins or paperclips to\u00a0 clip the correct answer.\n\nWhen I introduce each of these type of activities, I tend to have the whole class working on the activity at once so I can really answer any questions, we can talk about behavior expected for our routines, and I really just introduce these like I would an other routine or part of our day.\n\nAfter that practice, our centers and small group or partner work goes much more smoothly!\n\nDo you have any other \"go to\" activities?",

We used a combination between workshop and a guided reading/ station type approach, so these stations came in handy.

It feels like things have changed so quickly with long term school closures popping up amid this very strange time in our country and world.\u00a0 I have been working from home since my little gal was born, and I'd love to share some things that might help you as you head into the depths of what they're calling online or distance learning.\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Designate a work space:\u00a0</span></h2>\nIf you don't have a designated work space at home, it may be\u00a0 super tricky to get and stay\u00a0 focused. You also may want an area where you can display a small white board or chart paper so you can share with your students.\u00a0 Then when it's work time, you'll have that designated space.\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Before you panic, check with your district!\u00a0</span></h2>\nThere are many many different models and expectations of what distance learning looks like. Some of the general models I've seen shared are:\nSynchronous- when all students are working/ learning, maybe even together at the same time (think video chats, text chats, online conferencing). During this kind of learning the teacher and students may be expected to be logged into a system at a scheduled time.\n\nAsynchronous- This is when a teacher shares a series of work and perhaps instructional content or videos to direct students and then they work independently to complete the work on their own time, usually with some expectation of deadlines etc.\n\nBlended- I have no idea if that's what they officially call it, but many of the models I've seen teachers talking about incorporate a blend. This may include a teacher logging in for a short live video (maybe a recording is posted in case anyone misses it), and then a series of assignments are given. The teacher may schedule some times for all students to login to introduce a new concept etc, but it's not a constant 6.5 hour process.\n\nSo before you panic and envision all sorts of hoops you'll be having to jump through, check with your district to see what tools they are providing you with, what model they're going with, and what their expectations are for students.\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Expect change</span></h2>\nChange will be constant! The resources you have access to, schedules, and even your entire approach may change and evolve as time goes on. Expect that to happen! The student you're worried about and may want to connect with each day 1:1, may do better with self paced videos. The students you expect to fly right through the day, may feel comforted to see your face on the screen. You'll find out along the way!\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Communicate with Parents</span></h2>\nCommunicate with parents early and often. Being a trained teacher and a mom, I see TONS of parents freaking out about this whole distance learning thing and what it means for them and their kids.\u00a0 They didn't sign up to homeschool, for the most part they aren't trained teachers, and they are feeling like they won't know what to do (after all most of them have hated the Common Core forever anyway). They don't know if they'll be able to access the tools they need, or if the schedule will work. Communicate regularly, ask how you can support them, and chat by e-mail, phone, or whatever way helps them to know what to do.\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Consider Routines</span></h2>\nRemember back to the first few weeks of school when you practice routines again and again? You practiced lining up like 5000 times to get the routine down? Well these are brand new routines. When I practice routines with my students, typically I name the routine as an objective. Remember to do that now too. Consider the first few times you use a new program or tool, or the first few times you chat, to have the focus be on the chatting or on the use of the tool, instead of on new academic content.\u00a0 You can probably help relieve some frustration by focusing on the function and routine first.\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Remember Social Emotional Learning</span></h2>\nI feel like when I looked at my schedule, there were always those little learning moments that were so valuable. We addressed them as they came up and students learned from them. These moments weren't always written in the planbook (although sometimes they were). Remember that families are stressed right now, kids are stressed, and it's worth talking about some of those important social emotional topics (how to handle frustration, communication, gratitude).\n<h2><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Give Yourself Grace</span></h2>\nKnow that in your teacher heart you are doing your very best with what you have.\u00a0 If someone lashes out, know it probably has very little to do with\u00a0 you and more to do with their struggle. If you feel like something didn't go well, adjust and move forward. This is new, but you are going to knock it out of the ballpark!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI've already started creating some digital resources for you including a reading response freebie created with Google Forms.

It's a widespread real thing in our world right now. As I write during the Coronavirus/ COVID-19 outbreak, schools across the US have shifted to online learning activities. I have been chatting (Virtually) with my teacher friends, I have been a parent in the community, and I have been working to create resources to help teachers to meet the needs of their students during this time.\n\nThe truth is ....Parents Feel Stress/Overwhelmed about the concept of \"homeschooling\".\n\nWe have received dozens of e-mails from teachers. Some of them are extremely long. As a parent I see how overwhelming that can be. I don't know which e-mails my child (specifically my 7th grader) has been receiving and has already addressed (login etc). Because of this overwhelm, I have seen and heard of parents skipping the e-mails altogether.\n\nHere are a few ideas I have about helping to address these concerns with parents to help you communicate realistic expectations to families early and succinctly but completely.\n<h1>1.Communicate early on that this is not \"Homeschooling\"</h1>\nI keep hearing from the parent crew I keep in touch with that they are NOT teachers and don't know how to teach their children. Assure them that this is NOT homeschooling. While they might be able to help their children with a thing here or there, assure them that the content will come from you.\u00a0 This has the opportunity to take a huge burden off of parents shoulders.\n<h1>2. Plan e-mails thoughtfully</h1>\nHere's the thing- It took you a LONG time to write that 2 page email- to think of the important parts. But parents are not ready to receive that level of information. Some have information overload. Others are under huge family and financial strain and are already struggling.\u00a0 It's a huge challenge to balance that communication level.\n\nConsider writing e-mails with numbered or bulleted information. It might\u00a0 look something like this-\n\n\"Hi there, I hope you're doing well.\n\nAs your child's math teacher here are a few important things to know in summary (details follow below)\n<ol>\n \t<li>Your child must login and join my Google Classroom here ______</li>\n \t<li>Your child will receive a daily e-mail by 9am with daily expectations on their Google Classroom.</li>\n \t<li>I will be updating grades in _____weekly.</li>\n \t<li>Please know that while we are encouraging and expecting full participation in these distance learning activities, I am flexible, understanding and here to help.</li>\n</ol>\nThen consider going through and offering more details at the bottom of the e-mail.\n<h1>3.\u00a0 Follow up with quick alerts rather than long e-mails</h1>\nServices like <a href=\"https://www.remind.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Remind</a> are great for sending parents pertinent information in a way that is not all lost within their e-mail. They can receive the messages through text/ email/ app. This is great if there's a specific meeting you'd like to announce to the class, or if there's some action parents need to take. You can also message parents individually this way, and I find that these type of alerts tend to get my attention and be easier to digest because they are designed to be short calls to action.\n\nIt's also nice to reach out to parents through an app like Remind with a quick message about students. It's easy to get the message to them however they select in the app. Imagine how nice it would be for a parent to get a message that said \"So proud of ____ hard work! Great job!\" Those sorts of quick messages can make a difference!\n<h1>4. Have you thought of releasing a video or voluntary video chat meeting with parents?</h1>\nI bet seeing your face, understanding your calm and flexibility, will help to remind them that you're human and will help communicate your passion for giving their children the gift of education during this difficult time. (Maybe those who are being in a tough total freak out mode will even soften up a bit).\n<h1>5. Keep communication consistent.</h1>\nI have to say that the first week of distance learning we received long e-mails sent to all students from each teacher. We had so much information and then... nothing. Silence in many cases. I'm hearing that from other parents too. They are feeling like, especially with older children, if they hear nothing it must be good news. I think sending a very short updated e-mail consistently to parents could really help them to remember that you are on the same team, and really continue to build the home-school partnership.\n\nIf you have some further suggestions, please feel free to add them in the comments... and keep going, you're doing great!",

    "content": "Recently with a shift in distance learning, teachers are working hard to give their students access to books without being in the actual classroom for the read aloud experience.\n\nI have always loved my<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fairy-Tales-Unit-Bundle-Printable-Digital-Components-for-Distance-Learning-1850969\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> fairy tales unit</a> in the elementary classroom, and I used many of these comprehension activities to help teach<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/i-believe-in-fairy-tales/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> comprehension skills with fairy tales</a>. To support teachers during distance learning I have added some of the activities digitally using Google Slides, but I realize now that the physical books are missing this can be a problem.\n\nHere are some links to versions of favorite fairy tales. These links are not to my own videos or text, to please be sure that the links still work and are appropriate for your students before sharing them! I have commented on each one in regards to how compatible with my fairy tale comprehension resources it is.\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Jack-and-the-Beanstalk-Activities-Print-Digital-Distance-Learning-1752660\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jack and the Beanstalk</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zurz-pL-uzw\">Jack and the Beanstalk by Best Children's Stories</a>\n\nThis version simply fits best with the basic comprehension and sequencing materials included. It does in go into a deeper discussion at the end of the story, which may be hard for the students to understand, but the actual version of the story is compatible.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VCpAYajmvo\">Jack and the Beanstalk by KiddoStories</a>\n\nThis version of the story actually has Jack go up the beanstalk three times, so it is a more extended story than the basic retell, but could still work with the comprehension materials.\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Little-Red-Riding-Hood-Activities-Print-Digital-Distance-Learning-1763048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Little Red Riding Hood</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_akuIFFpws\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Little Red Riding Hood video by Little Cozy Nook</a>\n\nThis is a read aloud version of James Marshall's story. It does have the wolf eating the grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood as well as a hunter killing the wolf, so just check it out if you'd like to use this version. I have versions of vocabulary for both a hunter and wood cutter in my comprehension materials, so this version should work fine.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDMWJCrDVMI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Little Red Riding Hood video by Gigglebox</a>\n\nThis is an animated and narrated version of the basic story.\u00a0 In this version the wolf does swallow Little Red and the grandma, but the woodsman comes and shakes them out of his mouth and then the wolf runs away.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba2hJM3DxG4&amp;t=29s\">Little Red Riding Hood video by Kiddo Stories</a>\n\nThis one is a basic version, great for beginning retelling. The wolf locks the grandmother in the closet and then a woodcutter comes and \"beats\" the wolf to rescue them. This is my favorite version to match the comprehension resources I have created.\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Goldilocks-and-The-Three-Bears-Print-Digital-Distance-Learning-1675193\">Goldilocks and the Three Bears</a></h1>\nI'll be honest,\u00a0 the plot of this story varies very little, so it is easiest to find versions for this story that closely match.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KndSVsY5HWM&amp;t=29s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goldilocks and the Three Bears by Kiddo Stories</a>\n\nThis version is my favorite for teaching comprehension and using the materials I have created.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4pBElqFgEY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goldilocks and the Three Bears Read Aloud video by James Marshall's Fairy Tale Collection</a>\n\nThis is a video version of the James Marshall story.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Three-Little-Pigs-Print-Digital-Distance-Learning-1644080\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Three Little Pigs</a></h1>\nOnce again this is another story which doesn't vary widely. The basic differences, such as whether the wolf eats the pigs or not don't really affect the retelling materials I have created.\u00a0 In my version of the sequencing, I did make the last slide a picture of the fireplace, so the ending is pertinent to those digital pages, however the print versions have flexibility with the ending.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtP83CWOMwc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Three Little Pigs by Kiddo Stories</a>\n\nI love this version because it is basic and clear enough for comprehension skills for beginning readers. This version does not have the pigs being eaten, and does involve the wolf falling into the boiling water, but he jumps right up the chimney and runs away.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/The-Little-Red-Hen-Print-Digital-Distance-Learning-Activities-1984607\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Little Red Hen</a></h1>\nThe biggest variation in versions of this story are the different animals that are in different versions. I refer to the animals very generally in the comprehension resources so it supports many different versions.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E72TZy0LNo&amp;t=29s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Little Red Hen Read aloud by Curious World</a>\n\nThis is a great story for children who are reading because it shows and highlights the text as they read.\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Three-Billy-Goats-Gruff-Retelling-and-Activities-2580050\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Three Billy Goats Gruff</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QzT1sq6kCY&amp;t=122s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Three Billy Goats Gruff video by Giggle Box</a>\n\nI love this version of the story. It's basic, but also has some descriptive words in in. It also works well with the visuals (including the troll falling into the water with a big splash.)\n\nTo check out my fairy tale comprehension unit activities, click here!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fairy-Tales-Unit-Bundle-Printable-Digital-Components-for-Distance-Learning-1850969\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2210\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/original-1850969-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;",

    "title": "Guided Reading during Distance Learning",
    "content": "Distance learning is a challenge for so many teachers, but I keep thinking back to the classes of first graders I spent so much time teaching in small groups, in a really responsive way as they navigated early reading. I got to thinking, what in the world could guided reading look like during distance learning?\n\nHere are a few ideas I'd like to share!\n<ol>\n \t<li>Send home paper printable books- I know that while some districts have gone totally digital, others are still offering paper resources to students. While you may not have many hard copies of books, you could print paper emergent readers for students to keep at home.\u00a0 I have a few offered here:</li>\n \t<li>ZOOM or Google Meet- Depending on the platform approved by your district, you could schedule guided reading group sessions with students! If you can share your screen, you could have photos of a book to flip through on your screen. You could also share your screen with a board like this free letter board. While students can't interact with it, you can model word building and have them write on a piece of paper or whatever they have available.</li>\n \t<li>BOOM Lessons- I just created my very first BOOM emergent reader. I tried to create it with a guided reading group flow in mind. First, students build some sight words, then they listen to/ read the story and identify the color word (active reading), and it goes on to offer some scrambled sentences using the words in the story. Finally, students get to choose their favorite color to wrap up with a personal connection. I also was able to record voice instructions and reading of the text. I think this method can be super useful because BOOM is self checking and can give students feedback, while providing them with a lesson flow. While you're not face to face, if you have an account you can also see how they're doing.</li>\n \t<li>Google Slide independent assignments. You can purchase or write some little emergent readers of your own to share with your students via google slides. Then they can practice reading digitally whatever text you'd like them to be reading. Drop in a comprehension check at the end, and you have some of the components of a reading lesson there.</li>\n</ol>",

    "content": "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2241\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Digital-Bubble-Activities.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" />\n\nIt's currently the first week in June and while some schools are out already,\u00a0 here in Connecticut, we still have a couple weeks left.\u00a0 \u00a0 Usually the weeks between Memorial Day and the end of the school year are what kids look forward to as the \"Fun Times.\" Usually these are the weeks full of school assemblies, performances, field trips, field day, and fun classroom activities.\n\nAs I looked back on some of my favorite end of the year themed days (you guys know I'm a sucker for a good theme), I started imagining how these fun days could be brought to kids digitally.\n\nToday I'm going to share about one of my favorite days of the entire year. In fact, when I visited my class during my maternity leave, this is the day and these are the activities I chose to share with them.\n<h1><strong>BUBBLE FUN</strong>-</h1>\nA few of my favorite things to do on Bubble Fun day were making our own bubbles, designing bubble wands, and then playing bubble themed math games. How can we share in this fun digitally? Many of my teacher friends from around the country have a system set up in their school district for distributing items to students (printable activities etc) and if you have this system, you could even send a little package with bubbles and pipe cleaners home for children, but they could also experiment with bubbles they have at home or soap and water. You could even host a class Zoom where children share their creations or blow bubbles together.\n\nI always used these printable resources, but in consideration of going digital, I've created same of these components digitally:\n<h2>Bubble Writing-</h2>\n<strong>Story writing</strong> about climbing inside a giant bubble is a super fun and imaginative and it was always one of my students' favorite prompts. I've created a digital format to share using Google Slides. This part comes complete with a Google Form narrative checklist\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/63b432a8-a413-11ea-950b-42f8f90fddc5/bubble-writing-digital\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2234\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bubble-writing-previewdigital3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"209\" height=\"209\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Shape poems</strong> are also one of my favorite descriptive writing meets poetry tasks to use throughout the year.\u00a0 The digital version offers an example and directions that could be shared digitally with students. Then you could compile the final slide where students share their work to create a virtual class bulletin board.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/63b432a8-a413-11ea-950b-42f8f90fddc5/bubble-writing-digital\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2235\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bubble-writing-preview-digtial4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"248\" height=\"248\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Opinion Writing</strong> is another one of those activities that just goes so much better when children have some concrete experience to relate to. This prompt worked so well for me after giving them some time outside to explore with bubbles. The digital version here has planning page, writing templates, and a Google Forms checklist depending on how formal you want to make the assignment.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/63b432a8-a413-11ea-950b-42f8f90fddc5/bubble-writing-digital\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2236\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bubble-writing-digitalpreview2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"215\" height=\"215\" /></a>\n<h2>Bubble Science</h2>\n<strong>Explore and Observe:</strong> All year long, but especially at the end of the year I love to give children the opportunities to explore and observe. I'd typically just fill big containers with bubbles and ignore the spills and sticky messes and encourage them to go to town. Then I'd use either a KWL chart or an \"I notice, I wonder\" activity for them to respond to what they experienced. This can still be done digitally as long as your students have access to bubbles!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Bubble-Science-and-STEM-Activity-Printable-Digital-with-Google-Apps-4523021\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2239\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/original-4523021-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"267\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Create and Engineer -</strong> This bubble wand STEM is perhaps my favorite of all the included activities. At home, children can use whatever supplies they have, but if you've sent home a little kit with pipe cleaners, they work perfectly. Then they try to engineer a way to blow bubbles or make a bubble wand.\u00a0 This is another super fun activity that could be taken digitally!\n<h2>Bubble Themed Math:</h2>\nBringing math into the fun theme always encourages them. In the classroom I always try to tie the theme to one of our familiar activity types, so they can play pretty independently. I've brought this Bubble Bump activity digital for free here:\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/396614ea-a1dd-11ea-950b-42f8f90fddc5/bubble-bump-digital-resource\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2233\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/thumbnail1-bubble-bump-digital-resource.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"151\" height=\"151\" /></a>\nWhile it does entail either having the appropriate dice, or using a digital dice website, it can still be done either independently or with a family member at home. If your students are allowed to connect via Google Meet or Zoom or something, you could also have them interact and use the same shared slide file as a game board as they play live.\n\nHopefully you are able to squeeze some fun into these last few days!\n\nHappy Teaching!",

Typically, here in CT that means that teachers are finally able to let go of the worries of the classroom and enjoy the sunshine. This year is so much different! I tend to shy away from writing time specific posts because I want to help as many teachers as possible as years go by, but this year is just so different. My news feed is full of people playing a tug-of-war game over almost every issue, one of the biggest ones is... What in the world will Back to School 2020 look like? <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/where-to-start-preparing-for-back-to-school-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Where should I even start to prepare?</a>\n\nThe teachers I know aren't resting. They're worrying. They thought the end of the school year, and the end of distance learning would bring relief, but the truth is, it's brought more uncertainty.\u00a0 I'm worrying. What will I do? What will we choose for our children. I won't go down the rabbit hole here because we're in the rabbit hole all day. Remember... <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/hard-not-impossible/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hard is not impossible</a>. We are going to figure this out.\n\nI really say all this to justify my feeling to need to start talking back to school time a little earlier than usual. Not because I don't want you to have that time to unplug or rest, but because I think the sooner we share ideas and begin to wrap our heads around the possibilities, the sooner we'll hopefully be able to sneak in those restful days.\n\nI want to write and support you through this situation. I want to share and create to support your classroom needs whether in person or online, so you'll see while some of what I share will be specific to certain circumstances... much of it will be right in the middle.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/where-to-start-preparing-for-back-to-school-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2272\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/In-school-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"232\" height=\"194\" /></a>\n\n<b>As we focus on the middle here are some of the important topics and considerations to think about.

Some of you will even use a different model based on the time of year and circumstances where you live. School-Home communication has never been more important!\n\nI wrote earlier this year about considerations for keeping those relationships strong through the quarantine and <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/parent-communication-distance-learning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">distance learning transitions</a> and a couple years ago I even wrote covering many of these concepts (<a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/5-tips-for-starting-the-year-with-strong-school-home-partnerships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>). Many of those tips are still super applicable when you think about how to communicate with parents. In fact, these tips actually align pretty closely with them.\n\nI wanted to write more because I keep thinking about how in times of uncertainty we can focus on all the things that fall in the overlapping parts of the venn diagram. This is how we can start. One thing that won't change much is how important communicating with parents and families will be.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2272\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/In-school-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"357\" />\n\nHere are some things to consider, no matter how or where you teach:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/5-steps-to-writing-a-perfect-summer-letter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Send a summer letter</a></strong>- Introductions are super important and so much about sending this letter is the same whether you're in person or online.

Invite communication before the first day of school- Be creative with scheduled visits, videos etc. depending on your schools policy.\n\n4. Follow up the first week with a phone or video call. <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/5-tips-for-starting-the-year-with-strong-school-home-partnerships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(This post has more about this and the checklist I use)</a>\n\n5. Share clear classroom expectations\n\n6. Plan an in person or virtual back to school night event. Personally invite families.\n\n7. Stay in touch!",

Between colleagues, between teachers and students, and between school and home.\n\nNow, more than ever, communication is key. Especially in order to share expectations and details about changes that are unique to the times.\n\nI've heard from teachers that during distance learning it was often tough to keep in touch with parents. Setting up a system for communication at the start of the year is a great way to ensure that you have multiple communication methods and can choose the one that's best for your families.\n\nHere are a couple of ways you can keep in touch with parents this school year along with pros and cons of each :\n<h1>Phone Call</h1>\nSometimes a quick phone call is the best way to get in touch with a parent. Consider if you need feedback or will need to really have a back and forth conversation. If so, a phone call might be the best way to communicate.\n\nPros:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Family can hear your voice (and understand your tone)</li>\n \t<li>Opportunity for immediate clarification and feedback</li>\n \t<li>Quick response</li>\n \t<li>Builds personal rapport</li>\n</ul>\nCons:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Can be time consuming</li>\n \t<li>The time you are available may not be convenient for families</li>\n \t<li>There is no record of your conversation</li>\n \t<li>It's hard to illustrate a point with a visual</li>\n \t<li>Typically happens with one family member (or maybe 2 if on speaker)</li>\n</ul>\nI might make a phone call to: discuss a serious issue, ask a quick question that I need feedback for, to periodically check in with families.\n<h1>E-mail -</h1>\nE-mail is\u00a0 a convenient way to keep in touch about more basic communications and general notices for the classroom.\n\n<strong>Pros:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Quick to send along</li>\n \t<li>Can include visuals or photos</li>\n \t<li>You can use templates to help you send e-mails quicker</li>\n \t<li>You can reach more than one family at a time</li>\n \t<li>Families can respond at their convenience</li>\n \t<li>Time to check into things (like a schedule) before responding</li>\n \t<li>Creates a record of communication</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Cons:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Generally not as personal</li>\n \t<li>Cannot \"hear\" your tone or ask clarifying questions which may lead to miscommunication</li>\n \t<li>Some may not have access to , or may not access e-mail regularly</li>\n</ul>\nI might use e-mail to: schedule a meeting. send a classroom newsletter or general communication, ask a quick question (Shelby thinks she's supposed to get hot lunch today, but she has a lunch in her backpack. etc), or check in about the day if that is the routine plan for a child. I do NOT use e-mail to introduce or share issues (academic or behavioral) unless is it the only option available to me.\n<h1>Communication app like Remind</h1>\nI have used Remind as a part of our Parent Teacher Organization and there are some great benefits!\n\n<strong>Pros:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Parents get to sign up to be contacted the way they'd like (text, e-mail, app)</li>\n \t<li>Scheduled messages</li>\n \t<li>Ability to send images/ files ( great for newsletters or school or class wide communications)</li>\n \t<li>Ability to send messages to individuals or groups</li>\n \t<li>Great for short messages, reminders, bulletins</li>\n \t<li>Option to allow family members or students to contact one another within the class</li>\n \t<li>Can contact students directly where appropriate</li>\n \t<li>Option for paid school plan with more admin functions and features</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Cons:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>you can only send short messages with character limits (at least with the free account)</li>\n \t<li>number of classes on the free account limited although this has never been an issue for me personally</li>\n \t<li>Some families still might have struggles with ability to access if they do not have technology or internet access.</li>\n</ul>\nPersonally, I'd use Remind to: Send out bulletins, reminders, or documents, links to a scheduler, send photos.

It's hard to imagine what's coming next for teachers and students in this very different Back to School 2020 season.\n\nUncertainty often builds anxiety and worry, and for me, activity helps to overcome all those feelings. The problem is that it's also difficult to know what is worth your time planning. If you plan a beautiful bulletin board, will it all go to waste if you end up distance learning? If you plan for tons of digital activities and teach all in person, you might feel like you missed the mark.\n\nStorytime!\n\nI'd like to share a little story about what happened to me one year. I had been teaching with the first grade team at my first school for a couple of years. Enrollment was down, so it was pretty certain that I was going to be moving to kindergarten the following year (all pending budgetary approvals). When I left at the end of the school year I was pretty sure this was the case, so I began planning for all things Kindergarten. I learned and bought materials and games... I spent so much time on the parts that were unique to Kindergarten...but mid summer I was away on a little family trip and I checked my e-mail and happened to see some notes from the Board of Ed meeting. They hadn't actually approved that additional section of kindergarten. I knew I wasn't least senior so I had a job, I just had no idea where it would be! I ended up being transferred to another school in the district\u00a0 (and packing a classroom with morning sickness as I was pregnant with my littlest), and the position was... first grade. Now luckily there is some natural overlap between the two areas so not all that planning and buying was wasted, but a lot of it I ended up passing on to kindergarten teachers.\u00a0 I know this is nothing compared to a pandemic. It was small scale, but it was then that my tip for uncertainty was born...\n\nSo here is my number 1 top tip for preparing to teach in uncertain times:\n<h2>-&gt; Plan for the overlapping parts of that venn diagram.</h2>\nI whipped up a quick one that illustrates a very very basic depiction of what the possibilities of this back to school season looks a little like.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2272\" src=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/In-school-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" />\n\nSee that little part in the middle? Spend your times of uncertainty planning for things that really apply no matter what!\n\nParent communication, classroom management, student engagement, delivering differentiated instruction... these are all things that will happen right in the middle. So instead of thinking of all the edge case \"stuff\", until you have a pretty firm plan from your district, focus on the middle!\n<h3><a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/back-to-school-2020/\"><strong>To take a deeper dive into some of these topics, read more about Back to School 2020 here!</strong></a></h3>",

She stares at the words, but nothing comes to mind.\u00a0 She says \"Reading is impossible.\" How do you respond?\n\nReally think about it. What would you say?\n\nDo you tell her \"You're right, let's close the book! It is impossible. Reading is cancelled\"? No way! You start looking for and teaching her strategies to navigate this new territory. It's hard, but not impossible!\n\nNow let's think back to just a few months ago in March. Distance learning felt impossible. Turns out you did it! It was hard but not impossible! You've already proven it can be done. Perfect? No Without serious drawbacks? No. But NOT impossible.\n\nWhat you're about to do this back to school season... Hard? Yes! Really hard? Absolutely! Uncertain and uncomfortable? Yes! But not impossible.\n\n...But you can and will do this. You've done hard things before.\u00a0 I'm not saying for a second that whatever plan your district develops is going to solve all problems, or even that you'll agree with it or think it's best. It won't serve every single kiddo or family in the very best way that your heart is so tied to doing. It's not going to be perfect, it's not going to be easy, and it's not impossible.\n\n<strong>You must know, it is possible. </strong>\n\n<strong>Online distance learning:</strong> Hard, but not impossible\n\n<strong>Hybrid instruction:</strong> Hard, but not impossible\n\n<strong>In person instruction with crazy social distancing guidelines:</strong> Hard, but not impossible\n\nJust be careful jumping on the impossibility bandwagon. If you're struggling to find a place to start in this hard time, <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/where-to-start-preparing-for-back-to-school-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this post might help you get started.</a>\n\nShift your mindset to focus on some of this advice from some very important and famous sources:\n\n<b>*\u201cPobody\u2019s Nerfect\u201d</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- Pam Beasley, The Office. Ok ok I know this quote really dates back to like the 50\u2019s in entertainment and was probably said even before then, but the sentiment remains.\u00a0 Don\u2019t expect to do everything right the first time. Remember to approach any school year, especially this one, with the mindset of growth, progress, but not instant perfection.\u00a0</span>\n\n<b>*\u201cWe\u2019re all in this together\u201d</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- High School Musical (sorry for the earworm).\u00a0 Learn from one another, share with one another.

When you expect the hard stuff, you'll be able to respond with positivity and change course when needed.\u00a0</span>\n\n<strong>Don't underestimate yourself. Don't for one second let the students and parents counting on you hear you say and believe that this is impossible. It is possible and YOU are about to prove it!</strong>",

I always spend time setting <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/collaboratively-setting-classroom-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">collaborative classroom rules</a>\u00a0, <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/peer-cooperative-problem-solving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">practicing collaborative problem solving,</a>\u00a0and building <a href=\"http://blog.printableprompts.com/establishing-quiet-classroom-routines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">classroom routines.</a>\n\nThis year feels a little bit different, with possibilities of varied, changing, and new visions of what your classroom might look like.\n\n<strong>Whichever model your school chooses, here are some thing practices that remain the same:</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Make it collaborative-</strong> Involve the students in discussion of expectations. Help your students understand and contribute to why these expectations are important.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Explicit instruction</strong> (with examples and non examples) - provide pictures,\u00a0 provide sorting activities etc. This\u00a0way your students really know and understand what's expected.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Modeling and practice-\u00a0</strong>provide examples for students at the start of lessons or transitions. Then make practicing these expectations your objective! Remember they can model for one another as well.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Feedback -</strong> provide students feedback for their behaviors and acknowledge positive behavior immediately and regularly.</li>\n</ol>\nWe've talked a lot about how the steps for teaching classroom expectations are the same, but we know there is a place where they diverge. Here's how you might apply these methods to different school models.\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>IN person Instruction (NO social distancing rules)</strong></h2>\nWhen you're teaching rules in any of the models really, these types of activities are fun and\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Start with posters and graphics:</h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/d7952da4-5106-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/classroom-rules-emergent-reader-sorting\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2312\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/school-rules-preview-blog1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"340\" height=\"339\" /></a>A picture really is worth 1000 words.

They can color them in, circle words they know, and practice reading. The ones I've created are patterned so even very young children can \"read them\". These are also great for if you'r socially distancing because you don't have to share books.\n\nAnd... remember those posters? They match the rules in the reader, so you can even make your own read aloud type booklet.\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Sort Away:</h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/d7952da4-5106-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/classroom-rules-emergent-reader-sorting\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2313\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/school-rules-preview-blog2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"357\" height=\"357\" /></a>\n\nCut and paste individual or group sorting (or both!) are great ways to get students to identify which behaviors follow classroom rules and which don't.

This freebie is a back to school \"role model\" response booklet.\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>In Person Instruction with Social Distancing:</strong></h2>\nYou can still complete the same types of engaging activities that you would with in person instruction, but there will be some differences.\n\nFor example, sharing is something my class normally encourages with our classroom expectations, however this year, sharing is not really ideal with many of the social distancing guidelines. I've also added some rules like Wash your hand and Keep a distance.\n\n<a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/engaging-ways-to-teach-classroom-rules-for-in-person-instruction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Engaging activities like an emergent reader, sorting, and posters can help (just like I've typically taught the rules) can still be done!</a>\n\nHere's the updated social distancing classroom rules resource I've created with precautions and usual classroom rules in mind. I've included a digital version of the posters and sort so you can do these activities on the interactive white board by the teacher where students might be able to see the board from their seats.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/e0d21eaa-bdfc-11ea-950b-42f8f90fddc5/classroom-rules-for-social-distancing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2318\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/classroomrules-forsocialdistancing-preview2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"239\" height=\"239\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/e0d21eaa-bdfc-11ea-950b-42f8f90fddc5/classroom-rules-for-social-distancing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2320\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/classroomrules-forsocialdistancing-preview4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"237\" height=\"237\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe individual cut and paste activities and booklets are actually perfect for social distancing since they don't need to be shared and each student can read the patterned text in order to practice remembering the rules.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/e0d21eaa-bdfc-11ea-950b-42f8f90fddc5/classroom-rules-for-social-distancing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2319\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/classroomrules-forsocialdistancing-preview3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"284\" height=\"283\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Not teaching some of these rules?

Don't forget to slow down to model and practice them just like you would if you were in school! It's worth the time investment for sure and it will actually probably put everyone at ease when they know what to expect!\n\nThis resource includes a very similar set of materials to the other school rules sets, but with distance learning and virtual meeting expectations.\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-2342 alignleft\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/classroom-rules-for-distance-learning-preview-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Classroom-Rules-for-Distance-Learning-Printable-and-Digital-5869237\"><img class=\"wp-image-2339 alignleft\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/classroom-rules-for-distance-learning-preview-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /></a><img class=\"wp-image-2340 alignleft\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/classroom-rules-for-distance-learning-preview-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /> <img class=\"wp-image-2341 alignleft\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/classroom-rules-for-distance-learning-preview-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3></h3>\n&nbsp;",

My biggest gripe with many of the apps or activities students were working on, was that the activities were almost always addressing very general skills (addition, subtraction, place value), but not those very targeted and specific lessons that I was teaching in the classroom (counting on to add).\u00a0 I also often never could get data about how students were performing, so if I am being honest, I'd hope that they were \"getting it\" when they looked like they were working diligently.\n\nI feel like I am always on the hunt to find resources that help to solve the kinds of problems I experienced so often. This past year, I have become SUPER excited about the possibilities available with Boom Cards.\n\nLet's start with some basic info about Boom- It is an online platform where teachers have accounts. They load what are called \"decks\" (activities) into their libraries and can assign to students either by giving students accounts, or by sharing a link with students. At first I looked at them sort of like digital task cards... but now recognize that they can be much much more!\n<h1>Here are 5 reasons I LOVE Boom Cards!</h1>\n<ol>\n \t<li>\u00a0Many of them are created by teachers, for teachers- This is an awesome perk because we know that teachers understand what works for students. Which kinds of manipulatives help to illustrate different skills. I often add drag and drop manipulatives that function almost just like real life ones do! Here's an example in a math deck, where students can drag and drop the counters to help them to solve math problems.<a href=\"https://wow.boomlearning.com/deck/place-value-to-100-iKSCFketxuqG9kW7E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2375 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-5-Reasons-to-Love-BOOM-Cards2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" /></a></li>\n \t<li>They can provide students with immediate feedback &amp; teacher data-\u00a0 Boom decks can be self checking, which means they often provide students feedback right away about if their answer is correct or incorrect. You can also collect data if you choose to create student accounts with a\u00a0 teacher membership (rather than fast pin links) you can see student progress and check in on how they did!<a href=\"https://wow.boomlearning.com/deck/their-there-theyre---spring-themed-practice-pzTXKbkQgH3bf2Lwv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2376\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-5-Reasons-to-Love-BOOM-Cards3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" /></a></li>\n \t<li>They are interactive &amp; support sound clips-\u00a0 Boom Cards have the built in ability to be designed to be interactive. You can have draggable images, click to select, type in boxes, and check off multiple choice answers.\u00a0 They also support sound clips. This is a HUGE one for younger learners in my opinion. There are many times when I have wanted to design a digital lesson using powerpoint or slides, but in edit mode (where students can interact), I haven't found a great way to include sounds. With Boom Cards I can voice record directions. I can also voice record words or sounds to help build those beginning phonological awareness skills. I can even create a card in the deck with a sort of guided practice using voice recorded directions.<a href=\"https://wow.boomlearning.com/deck/blending-short-a-words---onset--rime-2xkNEik7h77ruqE9h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2377\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-5-Reasons-to-Love-BOOM-Cards4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" /></a></li>\n \t<li>You can get specific- One of the things I have done as a creator is try to get really specific about the skills covered in many of my Boom Decks. You can find decks for \"Counting on to add 1, 2, or 3\" or very specific language arts skills. This is a major perk because it opens the door to allow for that sort of targeted technology practice whether you're using it as a center or a tool for virtual learning.<a href=\"https://wow.boomlearning.com/deck/counting-on-to-add-to-10-and-20---using-dice-visual-vi8J2CifoDJkEikaJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2378\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Copy-of-Copy-of-5-Reasons-to-Love-BOOM-Cards5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" /></a></li>\n \t<li>They are engaging- They truly feel more like a game than task cards for students. The fun sounds, ability to include graphics, and interactivity makes them a favorite practice for students.

    "content": "<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fairy-Tales-Unit-Bundle-Printable-Digital-for-Distance-Learning-1850969\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2390\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" /></a>\n\nFairy tales are seriously one of my favorite teaching units, especially for early elementary students. Not only do they usually follow a nice problem-solution story line, but there are SO many fun spin off type stories that make teaching and comparing versions so much fun.\n\nFrom Jack and the Beanstalk to Little Red Hen, these stories have helped me to teach and practice many different comprehension skills and meet lots and lots of standards.\n\nHere are a few of my favorite comprehension skills to teach using some of my favorite fairy tales:\n<h2>Story Parts</h2>\nWho were the characters in The Three Little Pigs? How about the setting in Little Red Riding Hood? Fairy tales are awesome for teaching story parts because they have very clear text parts. You can do this by creating a story mat where students draw the setting on a large piece of paper and then use characters to move about the mat in order to orally verbalize their understanding of the story.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/83170718-46be-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/gingerbread-man-story-activities\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2391 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teaching-reading-comprehension-with-fairy-tales.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" /></a>\n<h2>Character Traits</h2>\nIn many fairy tales, the characters have super clear character traits. Think of Goldilocks and how her actions help children to learn about her.\u00a0 There are also often other characters that nicely create natural discussions of compare/ contrast (think the little pigs and the big bad wolf).\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/155dcef6-f74e-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/goldilocks-and-the-three-bears-activities\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2392\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" /></a>\n<h2>Retelling</h2>\nRetelling stories is one of the ways that we measure comprehension, as well as help students to understand how all of the parts and character traits work together to create a story in sequence.\u00a0 Some stories have events that are not important to tell in order, but fairy tales are different. The plot of these stories is very logical, so it's a great way to introduce retelling. I love using retelling mats to help students orally recite the story. Then that sort of oral retell can transition to writing about reading, including completing parts of a retelling booklet.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/3d151c8a-f503-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/jack-and-the-beanstalk-literacy-activities-digital-component-for-distance-learning\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2393\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teaching-reading-comprehension-with-fairy-tales1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" /></a>\n<h2>Summarizing</h2>\nIf your students have a good grasp on retelling and story parts, you might be reaching for a way to teach summary.\u00a0 Using a familiar story with a clear story line is a great place to start. It can help students to begin to write a summary. I like to still use the First, Next, Then, Finally guide words to help students. It is a great time to teach how to sort of group \"retelling\" events together in order to fit a summary into that framework with guide words.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/870a1854-fa80-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/three-little-pigs-activities-fairy-tales\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2394\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" /></a>\n<h2>Comparing Versions</h2>\nSeriously, this is one of the most fun things to do. From the Goatilocks, to Little Red Hot to The Snow Bears.... authors have done some really fun spin offs of traditional fairy tales that are super relatable and usually funny that help to reinforce all of the other comprehension strategies.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/870a1854-fa80-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/three-little-pigs-activities-fairy-taleshttp://\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2395\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" /></a>\n<h2>Teaching Theme/ Lesson</h2>\nTeaching the theme of a story can be really difficult. It's even more difficult in a complicated story with an unpredictable story line. Fairy tales offer a great opportunity to talk about what the characters have learned in the story and what that means for you.\u00a0 What did the animals learn in The Little Red Hen? They learned that when you don't help do the work, you might not get the reward. What can you learn? Hard work is rewarded . Of course that will take a little bit of guidance, but because the plots are pretty clear in these stories, they seem to be stories that have really helped my students make the leap between the lesson in the story, to the theme or overall lesson.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fairy-Tales-Unit-Bundle-Printable-Digital-for-Distance-Learning-1850969\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2396\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1640\" height=\"924\" /></a>\n\nI've compiled some of my favorite fairy tale resources here with resources to use to teach the comprehension skills we've talked about here as well as some fun literacy and math extension activities.\n\nI've also been working to make a little list of favorite <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/fairy-tale-online-story-links/\">fairy tale versions</a> you can access mostly digitally (or some stories you can review digitally to decide if they're right for your fairy tale unit).\n\nCheck out all the fairy tale resources here:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fairy-Tales-Unit-Bundle-Printable-Digital-for-Distance-Learning-1850969\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2388\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Fairy-Tales-Unit-Bundle1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Henry-and-Mudge-Book-Study-Bundle-Printable-Digital-1787588\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2440\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>You guys and gals all know that literacy is my total jam. One of my favorite things about teaching little learners is how excited and energized they get when they really begin to read and are handed their very first chapter books.\n\nA first grade favorite (by springtime) is always Henry and Mudge.\n\nThe series is one of my favorites because the chapters are short enough to manage during a single reading session, the characters are great for beginning character studies, and there is such a huge series that once kids are hooked you can't get them to stop reading!\n\nI was always a huge fan of putting together meaningful classroom resources in a packet at the beginning of the book study. I really find that front loading the process of choosing those comprehension resources and getting them all copied at once makes my planning process much easier and it also helps to capture the \"story\" of their work without a bunch of loose papers flying around everywhere.\n\nI've created comprehension resources for some of the most popular books in the series and I've included many different components so teachers who choose to use the resource can choose the activities that make the best sense for each child or group.\n\nHere are some of the major components that are included:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Henry-and-Mudge-Book-Study-Bundle-Printable-Digital-1787588\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2439\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\nThese chapter questions are basic enough for students to complete on their own. They provide opportunities for visualizing, developing opinions, and checking for comprehension.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Henry-and-Mudge-Book-Study-Bundle-Printable-Digital-1787588\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2438\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nAsking students to share about characters is a great way to both practice getting information and evidence from the text, as well as to discover the evidence behind the inferences they've naturally made as readers.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Henry-and-Mudge-Book-Study-Bundle-Printable-Digital-1787588\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2435\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nComparing characters is a great second step to character analysis. Not only are students looking for evidence about characters but they are now comparing characters within the story.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Henry-and-Mudge-Book-Study-Bundle-Printable-Digital-1787588\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2434\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nSometimes you don't want to throw chapter questions at your students. Sometimes you're looking for a different way to measure comprehension or practice a different skill. Summary prompts as well as chapter maps are great ways to vary the activities students are completing.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Henry-and-Mudge-Book-Study-Bundle-Printable-Digital-1787588\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2437\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nI have always found that the writing students do is best when they have a great context for developing their opinions and ideas.\u00a0 Having students write on an opinion related to a text really helps them to think critically about the text, use evidence from the text, and support their own opinion... and of course, there's no wrong answer!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Henry-and-Mudge-Book-Study-Bundle-Printable-Digital-1787588\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2436\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nDo your students sometimes stare at their paper (or you) as they brainstorm for narrative writing? It is so much easier for them to generate ideas once they've recently read on the same topic! It's a great way to bring the context of the book into their own writing time.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Henry-and-Mudge-Book-Study-Bundle-Printable-Digital-1787588\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2433\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>Some of the stories lend themselves to some other activities, from cracking a code to sequencing. From making a list to a get well card- anytime I had a fun idea for an extension I also included that in the resource.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Henry-and-Mudge-Book-Study-Bundle-Printable-Digital-1787588\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2441\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Henry-and-Mudge-blog-resources.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>So it's true... during 2020 and 2021 many of us are going digital... like it or not! I have taken the chapter comprehension materials and adapted them the best I could for Google Slides so your students can access these materials no matter where they are!\n<h2>I hope you've gotten some ideas about how to build comprehension and guide discussion as your students read any early reader, with Henry and Mudge being one of my faves.

Early elementary\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nIt's spring!!! April is the first month that it feels totally like spring. We all know that spring fever tends to kick in something in April, and it becomes a little trickier to keep those kiddos engaged throughout the month. Here in CT we always have spring break in April, so I am\u00a0 not sure if that plays a part, but I'm always reaching for engaging activities this time of year.\n\nOne of my favorite ways to keep them engaged is to keep the practice relevant to them... which means one of my favorite things... thematic resources.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">Here are 10 of my favorite teaching resources:</span></h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/55393cf0-8fea-11eb-89a7-42f8f90fddc5/earth-day-math-fact-fluency-center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2472\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nI am all about activities students can use together, with a partner, and by this time of the year, you might be reaching for some easy differentiation!

You can have students practice addition, multiplication, or fact families of either. Different spinners also allow for differentiation.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/9d01e122-5cb5-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/how-to-dye-easter-eggs-procedural-writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2471\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nIt's a great time of year for hands on sequencing and how to writing. This how to Dye Eggs is perfect for Easter time, and makes for a great precursor to actually dying eggs if you're feeling brave! I also have a ton of other <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/How-to-Make-Bundle-Sequencing-and-Procedural-writing-6157043\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>how to activities</strong></a> that are perfect to use all year long!\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/c27135ba-7129-11ea-950b-42f8f90fddc5/april-word-problem-journal-digital-component-for-distance-learning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2470\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nWhen spring comes, it's a great time to be practicing spiraled review of math skills your students have been working on all year long.

This year I've also added a Google Slides version for students to access digitally in case you're distance learning.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/First-Grade-Spring-Literacy-Centers-Bundle-1765309\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2469\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nAnyone else a fan of print, laminate, and go literacy centers? This set of literacy centers lasts for weeks if you go through the differentiated versions and offer a few exposures to each activity.

I am going to have to make a confession here. I stinking LOVE frogs. As a teenager I owned every pair of silly frog socks known to human kind. I had frog shaped candles, and glass figurines. I just loved frogs.\u00a0 I loved them so much that my oldest son had an entire frog themed nursery (I'll save that throwback picture for an instagram post someday).\n\nIt's no surprise that in the classroom frogs were one of my FAVORITE things to teach about. First of all, I love thematic teaching, which I know I've mentioned before. It's really more like content based teaching... I think when children learn about something in the real world (like the life cycle of a frog) and they're engaged in the learning, they are more likely to be able to write opinion pieces, and even narrative stories because they have built some background knowledge.\n\nI just had to share some of my favorite frog themed books, as well as favorite resources for teaching all about frogs this spring (or any time you're feeling extra froggy).\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">Favorite Frog Themed Teaching Activities:</span></h1>\n&nbsp;\n<h3><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\"><strong>Frog Life Cycle Activities</strong></span></h3>\nFrogs are such awesome creatures to study the life cycle of.

Thanksgiving time is no exception.\u00a0 It's like all the things you've been practicing from letter formation to math facts are new when you have a turkey theme!\n\nIt's also the start of one of the busiest times of the year for me personally. We've got all of our own holiday chaos, and so do most other families... which leaves our students bringing that excitement into the classroom every day. It's good.... really... but it's also exhausting and harder than ever to keep them engaged all day.\n<h1>Here are 10 of my favorite Thanksgiving and Turkey themed activities.</h1>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/5aa4de58-f750-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/thanksgiving-math-color-by-number\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1. Thanksgiving Color By Number</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f8598636-f74f-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/thanksgiving-math-color-by-number-addition-to-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Color By Number Addition</a></h2>\nI had to list this first. If you're like me, and usually in a hurry, this one is probably something like what you're looking for.\u00a0 It's no prep, print and go... and the color by number or addition pictures are pretty much self checking. You can tell at a quick glance whether or not students have completed the activity correctly. They also love this sort of thing, and it's a great center activity or quiet work station while you're busy doing other fun things! <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/5-reasons-i-love-color-by-code-activities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Read more about all the other reasons I love Color\u00a0 by Number resources here:)</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f8598636-f74f-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/thanksgiving-math-color-by-number-addition-to-10\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2525\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" /></a>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ac99717a-46b9-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/thanksgiving-writing-i-am-thankful-with-a-twist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2. I am Thankful for Writing... with a twist!</a></h2>\nOk, you've probably done this prompt every single year right? And every year the kids write the same things on their turkey feathers or leaves or whatever way you choose to present their work. To be honest, even by first grade they were tired of listing things they were thankful for, which is why I just had to get creative. I started asking them to think of reasons to be thankful for ordinary every day things... a stapler, a chair, a lightbulb, doors! Their imaginations came to life! The pages included in this resource can also be used for the traditional prompt, but it might be fun to explore this alternative.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ac99717a-46b9-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/thanksgiving-writing-i-am-thankful-with-a-twist\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2524\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f9834de8-f750-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/thanksgiving-writing-unit-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3.\u00a0 Thanksgiving Writing Activities</a></h2>\nWriting is always one of the struggle areas for young learners since they are just\u00a0 building out background knowledge and sometimes have a hard time getting started. With fun prompts like \"Make a dinner plate shape poem.\" or the famous \"disguise a turkey\" prompt, you can make writing more engaging and fun. They can even practice using all those skills you've been working on (you know, like finger spaces, capitalization and punctuation!).\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f9834de8-f750-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/thanksgiving-writing-unit-activities\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2523\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/7156474e-47c7-11ec-9349-257a83652528/life-cycle-of-a-turkey-thanksgiving-science\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4. Life Cycle of a Turkey-</a></h2>\nCurious young learners love to learn about new things... especially animals! Learn all about the life\u00a0 cycle of a turkey using any book or resource you have in your classroom. Then students can practice what they have been learning about chronological order, applying vocabulary, and sequencing to tell about the life cycle of a turkey.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/7156474e-47c7-11ec-9349-257a83652528/life-cycle-of-a-turkey-thanksgiving-science\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2522\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ea690410-47c6-11ec-9349-257a83652528/thanksgiving-turkey-math-fact-spinner-game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5. Turkey Math Fact Spinner Game:</a></h2>\nThis activity is a great print and go activity that's super easy to differentiate. All you have to do is switch out the spinner or recording sheet to shift from basic addition to adding to multiples of 10, to fact families... and even to multiplication or division. Games like this are my favorite for centers because the students can really be practicing the fluency skill they need without needing a whole different activity.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ea690410-47c6-11ec-9349-257a83652528/thanksgiving-turkey-math-fact-spinner-game\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2521\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" /></a>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6f6edb22-47c6-11ec-9349-257a83652528/thanksgiving-turkey-word-work-game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6. Turkey Word Work Game</a></h2>\nThis is a perfect way to practice applying phonics skills and reading fluency with word families with your students. They can either play on their own, or use it like a bump game where they play with a partner! Again there are many spinners so you can choose the skills and have many days worth of a literacy center ready to go.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6f6edb22-47c6-11ec-9349-257a83652528/thanksgiving-turkey-word-work-game\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2520\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/9275f6a6-47c5-11ec-9349-257a83652528/thanksgiving-abc-booklet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7. Thanksgiving ABC booklet:</a></h2>\nPractice letter formation, recognition, and vocabulary building with this abc booklet. It's great for station work or warm up for students who need a little extra practice with letter writing, but might be ready for a bit more as well. There is also a sentence on each page to help students read left to right and use previously mapped high frequency words as well as to identify the letter sound when the sentence is read aloud by an adult.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/9275f6a6-47c5-11ec-9349-257a83652528/thanksgiving-abc-booklet\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2519\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" /></a>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Counting-Turkeys-Numbers-1-15-Digital-Boom-Cards-6162902\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8.

How to Make Butter</a></h2>\nThis is one of my FAVORITE activities to do in the days before Thanksgiving. I've typically done this with book buddies, or even as our activity for a little class party. You can help students to make butter and then so many of my students every year also bring the materials home and end up making butter at home for their family feast as well! It feels like magic to them.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ab0ef0d6-f750-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/making-butter-thanksgiving-science\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2516\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/c2896dca-fa7c-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/thanksgiving-number-line-activity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10.

Enter... Gingerbread theme!\n\nI've written before about how much I love tying themes into learning, and this time of year is no different.\n\nThere are tons of different ways to incorporate a fun gingerbread theme in your classroom and still get lots of learning and skill work done!\n<h1>Here are 8 of my favorites:</h1>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/How-to-Make-Gingerbread-Cookies-Sequencing-and-Writing-4168648\">How to Make Gingerbread Cookies:</a></h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/How-to-Make-Gingerbread-Cookies-Sequencing-and-Writing-4168648\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2559\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nThis is a wonderful sequencing or procedural writing task depending on how you plan to use it. There are picture cards, vocabulary cards, sequence and write, and even an opinion prompt at the end. This is tons of fun, especially if you're able to have students actually bake or decorate real cookies at the end! Even if they have to take them home, I put together little Gingerbread on the Go bags like this last year.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/How-to-Make-Gingerbread-Cookies-Sequencing-and-Writing-4168648\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2560\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"298\" height=\"168\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Gingerbread Play Dough</h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2558\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nI LOVE that homemade playdough is pretty easy to make, inexpensive, and the students LOVE IT! You can use it to practice so many skills (form letters, numbers, words, shapes), and it also works those hand muscles for a little fine motor practice. Not to mention it feels good and gives some nice sensory input.\n\nYou can even make a gingerbread buffet (this is my favorite) where students can use cookie cutters, and then decorate with beads, googly eyes, pipe cleaners etc. You could even have a listening activity where you give directions step by step and see how the students follow them to create the gingerbread cookie!\u00a0 For older children, they can even draw (or snap a picture) and describe their dough person<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/833792ce-5514-11ec-9349-257a83652528/gingerbread-draw-and-describe-free\"> (I've got a free template for that here)</a>\n\n<strong>My favorite dough recipe is:</strong>\n\n1 Cup flour\n\n1/2 Cup Salt\n\n1 1/2 Tablespoons Cream Of Tartar\n\n1 1/2 Tablespoons Veggie oil\n\n1 Cup water\n\nPut it all in a saucepan, let the pan heat up and then stir. Keep on stirring and trust the process! It will form a nice ball of dough.\u00a0 You can add your food coloring at the beginning as well, as long as things like cinnamon, nutmeg, or ginger! I have also used similar essential oils along with some brown food coloring.\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Man-Activities-2277354\">Gingerbread Retelling:</a></h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Man-Activities-2277354\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2554\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/8-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nRetell favorite gingerbread stories by making a retelling mat and going through the basic sequence of the story!\u00a0 This story is very sequential and has pretty clear story parts, so this is a great opportunity to practice this beginning literacy comprehension skill. <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Man-Activities-2277354\">(The print and go resource for retelling mat and summary writing is here!)</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Man-Activities-2277354\">Gingerbread STEM-</a></h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Man-Activities-2277354\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2557\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nCreate a structure to get the gingerbread person across the river!\n\nPut out a number of materials for students to try to get their gingerbread person across the \"river\". Then try them out and give students the opportunity to observe and make adjustments to try again. Some of our favorite materials to use are foil, popsicle sticks, marshmallows, tape, pipe cleaners, ribbon, bow, anything that you can think of!<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Man-Activities-2277354\"> (The print and go planning and response materials for this project are here:</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Man-Activities-2277354\">Gingerbread Write Your Own Ending:</a></h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Man-Activities-2277354\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2553\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/9-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nI list this one here before it's perfect to do after completing the STEM activity! Often times students will\u00a0 write in their new endings about how the gingerbread person built a structure (they can usually describe this is great detail because they've just had the hands on practice), to avoid the pesky fox.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Math-Fact-Center-7506347\"><strong>Gingerbread Spinners:</strong></a></h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Math-Fact-Center-7506347\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2552\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/10-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nThese fun spinners are a great way to practice number identification, or basic math facts! Different spinners and different recording sheets for this one make differentiation easy! If you have time to make your own you can, or you could purchase the ones I've made for you here!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Gingerbread House - Cardboard Box Project-</h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2556\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nThis one is awesome because it can be done in the classroom in groups, or as a home family project. Students can use materials and then either write about or complete a graphic project for the amount/ number of different materials used to complete the project! Ready made resources coming soon!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-House-Design-Area-and-Perimeter-Math-Project-7498114\">Design a Gingerbread House Area &amp; Perimeter Project:</a></h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-House-Design-Area-and-Perimeter-Math-Project-7498114\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2555\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nThis one is great to do alongside the cardboard box project, but could also be done just with the included materials! Students brainstorm and then create the floor plan for a gingerbread house. There are a few different options for the floor plan layout and there are even rubrics and examples included.\u00a0 It's a creative way to practice this basic math skill!\u00a0 If your students aren't ready for the area and perimeter version, there are pages included just for area where students could simply count the squares that make up each room.\n\nIf you're just looking for all the gingerbread fun stuff shown here and you like a good deal, I've bundled all these activities together at a discount here for you!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Man-Activities-Bundle-7507462\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2564\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gingerbread-fun-bundle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" /></a>\n\nWhich one of these activities are you most likely to try with your child or students?\n\n&nbsp;",

December is definitely one of those times.\n\nI\u2019ve made a list of 10 of my favorite themes to use in December (some of them I slide to January as well so they will probably make my January list as well). Some of the themes I have written about in more detail and you\u2019ll find links to those below, and others I\u2019m still working to share more about, but I hope the ideas will still help you!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2543 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nGingerbread theme is always a fun one. It's great for holiday season because it's not really holiday specific, but it does always feel festive. There are also so many ways to use the theme to incorporate math and literacy skills.\n<h4><a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/gingerbread-activities-for-the-elementary-classroom/\"><strong>I've actually written a whole blog post about this theme. You can check that our here!</strong></a></h4>\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2542\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nLearning about wild reindeer is super fun and engaging for students. We usually read some reindeer themed stories as well and the topic of Christmas reindeer vs. wild reindeer always comes up (we've even made a venn diagram using information from stories about Christmas Reindeer vs the wild reindeer from the informational text)\n<h3>I have a basic How a Reindeer Grows resource you might like <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/e872766a-5c30-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/life-cycle-of-a-reindeer\">here</a>!</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2535\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nChildren are always so curious to learn about how people around the world celebrate holidays, especially in December.\u00a0 It's great to recognize the diversity within how people around us celebrate and how people from different places also celebrate differently.\n<h4>This is the <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/December-Holiday-Celebrations-2918903\">resource</a> I used with my first graders (<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Winter-Holidays-Digital-Version-Research-and-Respond-50-off-24-hrs-6332422\">there's a digital version too</a>).</h4>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2544\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/December-Themes-blog-post.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nLearning about animals in winter is a great way to incorporate seasonal changes. Children can observe how they adapt and change to survive the winter. There are also some great stories like about our good friend Bear hibernating in his cave that students love to read.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2540\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nMany students in my area have experience with Hanukkah. It's fun and informative to learn about some of the traditions associated with celebrating this\u00a0 holiday.\u00a0 I used this <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Hanukkah-Vocabulary-Emergent-Reader-4237889\"><strong>basic vocabulary reader</strong></a> to introduce my first graders to some basic terms, and then we reinforced that learning with identifying the symbols <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Hanukkah-Color-By-Number-4481154\"><strong>in our color by code activities</strong></a>. It's always also fun to play a game of dreidel together!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2541\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nMany\u00a0 students are abuzz with excitement in December. If it's appropriate for your class, some Christmas themed activities may be fun!\n<h4>I've got a bunch of Christmas favorites <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/search?shop_id=172d6ede-f4f7-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5&amp;keywords=christmas\">here</a>!</h4>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2534 aligncenter\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nLearning about trees that survive the winter is so interesting to students, especially if you live in a place where other trees lose their leaves. Learning about<strong><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Life-Cycle-of-Coniferous-Trees-Evergreen-Tree-Science-3429096\"> how a coniferous tree grows</a></strong> is always a hit. Some of my favorite stories also include trees, so you can definitely make a literacy connection there. Check out The Night Tree by Eve Bunting if you're going to take on this theme! If you want to go more Christmassy with this one, I also put together a<strong><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/How-a-Christmas-Tree-Grows-Emergent-Reader-4250740\"> \"How a Christmas Tree Grows\"</a> emergent reader.</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2539\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nAnimals are always a hit, and cold weather animals are no different. I also often slide this theme to January because it's so much fun to do <strong><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Arctic-Animals-Report-and-Research-Activities-1819026\">independent research</a> </strong>and there are so many stories about penguins and polar bears and such.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2537\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nIf you live in a place where it snows, we all know those first few snowflakes of the year always have students out of their seats and lined up along the windowsill. Learning about snow or reading snow themed stories is a favorite for sure.\n<h4>If you want to get sciency, <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Snow-Activities-Science-and-Literacy-2278017\">this is a resource</a> I have created and used throughout the years.</h4>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2536\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nLearning about generosity is one thing, but December is great time to practice it! This topic can include gifts, giving, donating, and lending a helping hand. This is a great time to organize a class wide collection (or contribute to a larger school wide collection to help others. Whether it be holiday gifts, socks, or anything else, it\u2019s a great way to include real life community outreach in the season.\n\nIf you have any other topics you think I should add, or any of these you'd like me to write more about, leave a comment below!",

It can also be one of the most fun weeks of school if we take the time to incorporate fun activities into your day!\n\nI know that you are probably short on time, so I wanted to share 6 activities (and links to the printables) that I've used in my Elementary Classroom the week before break.\n\nI often run holiday centers the week before as well, and I've used a number of these activities during the class \"center celebration.\"\n\nAs always, before choosing activities, please be sure to think of which are appropriate for your current students.\n<h1>Here are 6 of my favorite Quick and Easy activities!</h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Activities-Quick-and-Easy-3460753\">DIY CUt &amp; Paste Bingo<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2574\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a></h1>\nKids love BINGO and you can put a fun holiday twist on the game with these Christmas themed cut and paste boards. You can have students color, or cut and glue their own pieces. Each Bingo board will be different. I like to make these early in December and print the board on card stock so we can use them all month long!\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Activities-Quick-and-Easy-3460753\">Word Scrambles</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Activities-Quick-and-Easy-3460753\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2572 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nUse the letters in some Christmas themed words to build new words. This is a great word building center. It's also really fun to do with partners as morning work. I've even done this during book buddies.\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Activities-Quick-and-Easy-3460753\">Build a Christmas Shape</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Activities-Quick-and-Easy-3460753\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2570\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nChoose a picture card and then try to figure out how to create something that looks like the object on the picture. These are different than pattern block templates, which show students how to make each of the shapes. Instead students can use pattern blocks to create it however they'd like! I like to have students use an ipad to take photos of their work when they do these types of activities. These also make a great math station or morning work tub activity.\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Activities-Quick-and-Easy-3460753\">Candy Cane Patterns</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Activities-Quick-and-Easy-3460753\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2573\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nThis is a favorite for math centers, morning tubs, or a holiday party craft. It's something students can take home with them. You can choose to include whichever colors you like. They also double as ornaments!\n<h1><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Color-by-Number-3391118\">Christmas Color By Code</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Color-by-Number-3391118\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2569\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nWhether you want a basic color by number template, or addition practice, this print and go practice is perfect. It's even self checking since you can see at a glance if the picture is completed appropriately! <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Color-by-Number-3391118\">If you're looking for color by number you can find those here!</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Color-By-Number-Addition-3397431\">Looking for addition color by code?

Whether you teach with thematic units or just want some fun themes to include along the way during the month, I've got you covered here. Some of these themes I use throughout the entire winter, so you might see them in my favorite <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/10-december-themes-and-topics-for-your-classroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">December</a> or <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/7-themes-for-elementary-classroom-in-february/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">February</a> theme posts as well.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2589\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nSnow is a wonderful theme for wintertime. If you're like me in the Northeast there's always excitement around the first snowfalls of the year. My students always loved learning about the different types of snowflakes and how snowflakes are created. I created this <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Snow-Activities-Science-and-Literacy-2278017\">printable snow science</a> unit for them. My third graders used these resources independently and I used the same resources for my first graders, but just supported them a bit more. Snow is also a great theme for including informational and narrative texts about snow.\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2588\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nTake things one step further with Snowman themed fun! My students love reading Snowmen at Night and all the associated stories and doing <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/First-Grade-Snowman-Story-Activities-3577795\">s</a><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/First-Grade-Snowman-Story-Activities-3577795\">ome related story activities</a>. Building a snowman is also a great procedural writing activity for students that has pretty clear steps. Preschoolers especially love snowman themed activities and I've created a set of resources for that <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Preschool-Snowman-Activities-5200791\">here</a>! Don't forget to build snowmen with snow dough!\n\nDon't miss this super cute snow stick craft idea and <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/snow-stick-winter-graphing-printable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free graphing pages</a>!\n\n<a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/snow-stick-winter-graphing-printable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2594\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Add-a-heading.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"191\" height=\"191\" /></a>\n\nRead my entire post about some of my favorite Snowman Printables <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/snowman-printables-and-activities-for-your-classroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!\n\n<a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/snowman-printables-and-activities-for-your-classroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2641\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"245\" height=\"138\" /></a>\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2587\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nThe New Year is a great topic especially for the first week back to school. You can cover calendar math, New Year around the world, and even goal setting. Squirrels New Years Resolution is one of our favorite New Year Story.\u00a0 I also love having a quick grab and go like a <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/New-Years-Color-By-Number-Math-Activity-3430865\">color by number</a> or <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/New-Years-Color-by-Number-Addition-3445189\">addition color by number resource</a> themed for the New Year.\n\nIf\u00a0 you're really busy over the holidays and want an easy and ready to go printable activity booklet, I have a free activity for that <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/free-printable-new-year-activity-booklet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!\n\n<a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/free-printable-new-year-activity-booklet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2600\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/new-year-booklet.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"352\" height=\"198\" /></a>\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2584\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nKids LOVE polar bears. They have almost all seen a picture or stuffed animal of a polar bear and it's so fun to learn about them. I always start the week asking kids if they think polar bears are cuddly or fierce. As the week goes on we learn more and more about them and then decide how we feel at the end of the week and write a really awesome opinion piece that they can even include text based evidence for their reasons! There are also some really cute cotton ball crafts to do with younger learners.\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2586\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nPenguins are another fun unit for students. It is also another great opportunity for informational and narrative text read alouds and research. You can learn about the <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Life-Cycle-of-A-Penguin-and-Research-Companion-3570553\">life cycle of penguins</a>,\u00a0 <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/First-Grade-Penguin-Story-Activities-3610993\">penguin story activities</a>, or even <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Penguin-Life-Cycle-Emergent-Reader-4344495\">informational emergent reader mini books</a> that they can take home with them.\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2585\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nIf you haven't already covered this theme, animals in winter is a great way to incorporate animal adaptations, read aloud narrative stories (Bear snores on), and hibernation.\u00a0 You can really focus this on even comparing how animals in different places have to adapt differently in winter (is Florida or Texas different for animals than Connecticut or Oregon?)\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2582\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/9-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nLearning about Martin Luther King Jr, the Civil Rights Movement and social justice is a topic that is great for this time of year. Children can learn about these issues in a way that is appropriate for them. For my first graders, we used <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/1555ecc0-5cb3-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/first-grade-martin-luther-king-jr-activities-and-emergent-reader\">this resource</a> to learn and write about Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2583\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/8-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nA new year is always a great time to set goals, and do some reflection. It's a great time to embrace kindness, peace, and tolerance.\u00a0 This theme also pairs nicely with Martin Luther King Jr. This <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Kindness-Color-By-Number-4497791\">Kindness Color by Code</a> is one of my favorites.\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2581\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/10-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nI know I've mentioned this in the text of some of the other topics, but I want to include goals and resolutions here (especially for those who are quick scrollers like me). Talking about the kinds of things you want to do, the actions and words you want to choose is a common theme for the beginning of the calendar year, or the school year. I'm looking for some ways to do this in some way that has follow up, so if you have any ideas for that please leave them in the comments below.\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2580\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/11-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nDepending on when your year stars, the 100th day might be sneaking up! We don't spend a whole week on this theme, but there is always at least one day that is full of 100th day fun!\u00a0 From <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/100th-Day-Color-By-Number-4458783\">color by codes,</a> to <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/100th-day-of-school-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">100 second challenges (check out the post and get the freebie here!)</a>\n\n&nbsp;",

Snowmen are one of favorite themes for January thematic units but would also be great for December!\n\nThis snow stick makes a great holiday gift for students, or even a craft project you can do with your students or children!\n\nI've created a quick and easy video to show how I created this little stick.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-wHeEkwZLo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The best part is the extension that follows. I have created a few different templates for students to use where they can either measure the snow on separate days, over time, or even in different areas during the same storm.\u00a0 These are all printable and no prep. Can you also do this graphing activity without the snow stick? Sure! ... But it's also really fun and not super expensive to make.\u00a0</strong>\n\nI used the following materials to make my snow stick:\n\n*5 gallon paint stir sticks (you could make smaller ones if you don't get much snow).\n\n*white craft paint\n\n*3x3 square and 1/2 inch by 8 inch strips of felt (for the hat and scarf)\n\n*Sharpies or permanent markers. You could also use paint but it's a little harder to be precise.\n\n*Mod Podge\n\n*Ruler\n\n*Hot Glue Gun\n\n*Small piece of ribbon or string to tie to the top.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen all\u00a0 you need to do is:\n\n1. Paint the stick white and allow to dry completely.\n\n2. Glue the 3x3 piece of felt across the top as the hat.\n\n3. Use a ruler to mark the inch marks on the stick using sharpie.\n\n4. Draw the face with sharpie.\n\n5. Mod Podge the stick and allow to dry completely.\n\n6. Tie the scarf around and cut fringes in the scarf ends and hat tip.\n\n7.

    "content": "Happy New Year!\n\nWhenever this post might find you, I hope you're having a great year!\n\nWhenever there is a transition to a new year, back from a break, or a holiday, it can be hard to plan. On top of needing to review classroom expectations, they come back with so much excitement and SO much to share.\n\nIn fact, I bet you can expect a student's hand to fly up mid sentence during a math lesson to tell you that someone caught a snowflake on their tongue. That's all it takes to start the domino effect... is that the right term or is it even more like the wave... of hands sharing everything from the color socks they wore on the day after Christmas to when their brother burped during dinner last night. Seriously... you know it's that random.\n\nWe can get things back on track by returning to classroom routine reminders, and keeping students on task and busy. I always say when they are chatting, give them something to chat about! (If they're getting too chatty, I've written about what to do when you have a noisy class here... the New Year is one of the times that inspired me to write about this topic). It's also interesting how much they forget over these holiday breaks. My students often forget the simplest procedures, like taking lunch count or sharpening a pencil.\n\nWe know those down times can really be ripe for students getting off task and being harder to reengage when they are getting back into the swing of things. It can be REALLY handy to have a little extra something for them to work on during those little bits of time that cause us the most trouble when it comes to classroom management.\n\nI love grabbing for something like a color by code or word scramble to keep them engaged and completing academic activities. What's better than one fun activity? A printable fold and go booklet that has a few different ones!\n\nYou can use these printable booklets for:\n\n*Morning work\n\n*Early Finishers\n\n*End of the day fun\n\n*Book buddies\n\n*Stations\n\n*Substitute plans\n\n*When that writing activity only takes 15 minutes instead of 25 :-)\n\nHere's a little peak at the New Year one I created.\u00a0 And because we all need a little pick-me-up in the new year.. <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/50fd56ee76b2/new-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click below to get it for free :-) </a>\n<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/50fd56ee76b2/new-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2600\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/new-year-booklet.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHappy Teaching!\n\n&nbsp;",

Sweatpants, slipper socks, drinking coffee while it's hot, and messy buns ALL. WEEK. LONG!\n\nAs we head back to school next week, there are sure to be some bumps in the road. Our students are just as used to the break as we are. They forgot how to sharpen pencils, sit in their seats, raise their hands, share... all the things.\u00a0 It's not a surprise that classroom management might be a struggle this New Year!\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">Here are a few tips I have that have helped me to get through January after a long winter break.</span></h1>\n<h2>1. Review classroom management routines like it's the first week of school.</h2>\nThis is the most important tip. I put it first on the list because your classroom routines and student behaviors really do influence the ability for the class to make progress on all of the academic tasks you've got planned!\nDust off those beginning of the year anchor charts and get back to the basics. <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/teaching-classroom-expectations-with-varying-school-models/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Explicitly talk about and practice routines and transitions throughout the day</a>. Make sure you're plugging this time into your plan book, because it really will take some time and make a difference.\nIf you've reviewed these expectations and you're still having the chatty class problem, <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/3-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-you-have-a-noisy-class/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">check out this post about what you can do when you have a noisy class and \"shhh\" isn't working!</a>\n<h2>2. Set a wellness promise... not a resolution-</h2>\nIt's so tempting to set productivity resolutions at the beginning of each year. These types of goals often have me losing sleep and tripping over my own feet. Truth be told, they are the last thing I need to step into the new year on the right foot. There is already so much to keep up with.\n\n<strong>Make a teacher wellness promise instead.\u00a0</strong>\u00a0One year, my promise to myself was to to leave 2 days a week at the contractual end of day time. That meant letting things go. It meant sometimes letting the bulletin board stay bare for an extra day, not totally organizing my desk before leaving, or closing my door during planning time to have a super efficient during that short 30 minutes. This goal was my reminder that most importantly, I needed to be home with my family more than any of those work related tasks I might be letting go with my wellness goal. Maybe for you it's leaving early, maybe it's getting a massage or pedicure monthly, or maybe it's starting small and not bringing work home one weekend a month. Think about a way to take some time back for you!\n<h2>3. Say YES to help!</h2>\nIt's hard to say yes to favors and help sometimes. If you're like me, it sometimes feels easier in the moment to do things myself. I feel like I am supposed to be doing it all and asking for a hand might mean I'm not doing a good job. Logically I know none of those things are true, but I definitely have to make an effort to say \"yes please\" when a colleague offers to grab my copies off the printer, or make a lunchtime coffee run. The thing is, even small favors can make a big difference.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick and easy freebie to kick of the new year and you want to say YES To that sort of help, <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/free-printable-new-year-activity-booklet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">check out this printable New Year Booklet!</a>\n<h2>4. Say no to things you can't take on-</h2>\nThis is going to be an ongoing problem because teachers, by nature, tend to be super giving and want to help all the time. It's good! It's so good until it depletes you and steals your time away from you. Take this small blurb as permission and a reminder to say no to that committee you just don't have time for!\n<h2>5.\u00a0 Set and review routines for problem solving-</h2>\nStudents tend to become sort of like siblings the more the year goes on. The bickering starts. They get on each other's nerves. This is a great time to establish routines for problem solving with peers cooperatively. While I use<a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/peer-cooperative-problem-solving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> this routine </a>from the beginning of the year, it really really came in handy in the second half of the year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm wishing you the best new year and I hope that it's everything you've dreamed of, and some quiet peaceful moments too!",

This year has been my year to share some of my favorite themes for different months and seasons. I know what it's like to look at the school provided curriculum, and thinking \"I need something to get my students excited about.\" Thematic activities have been a great way to engage my students while applying academic skills (research, informational reading and writing, narrative writing,\u00a0 reading comprehension, and even some math!)\n\nFebruary doesn't disappoint when it comes to thematic units and topics that are super fun for students!\n<h1>Here are 7 of my favorites!</h1>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2609\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nDon't forget that February 2 is Groundhog's Day! It's a great time to talk about seasonal changes, observations, and supporting opinions/ predictions with evidence. <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Groundhog-Day-Prediction-Opinion-Writing-1672613\">You can do the typical opinion writing \"Do you think the groundhog will see a shadow?\"</a> You can also jazz things up with <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Groundhog-Day-Color-By-Number-4502937\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">color by code activities,</a> and learning about<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Life-Cycle-of-a-Groundhog-and-Research-Activities-3591249\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the life cycle of a groundhog (here's a great comprehension and science activity combined).</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/search?shop_id=172d6ede-f4f7-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5&amp;keywords=valentine\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2610 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nValentine's Day is one of my favorite times of the year. I'll admit that all of the hearts and pink and red make me feel cheerful. It's also an awesome time to teach students about love, kindness, and friendship.\u00a0 Since I've worked at schools that do not allow the students to bring in sweet treats, and we can still make things special with arts and craft activities, fun math activities, and some of our favorite stories (The Love Monster is a definite favorite!) <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/search?shop_id=172d6ede-f4f7-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5&amp;keywords=valentine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out some of my favorite Valentine's Day Resources here!</a>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2612\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nAre you ready for some football? Students ( especially your sports lovers) will be super excited for the Superbowl! I'm not a huge sport fan myself, but the snacks at the Superbowl and the fun parties definitely are fun. My students have always been so excited if we had some fun football themed activities the Friday before or the Monday after the bowl. <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Football-Counting-to-12-Boom-Cards-Digital-6524296\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Last year I created this cute little Boom Card Counting Deck that is great for little ones this time of year!</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/100th-day-of-school-ideas/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2614 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nIf you haven't celebrated the 100th day yet, it usually falls sometime in February! This, of course, depends on the time of year that you start school. The 100th day is so fun especially for young students, although I've even had fun on the 100th day in 5th grade with students.\u00a0 One of my favorite things to do is a 100 second challenge. Think Minute to Win it, but 100 seconds instead! I have a <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/100th-day-of-school-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free booklet you can check out for the 100th day here!</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/100th-Day-Color-By-Number-4458783\">I've also got a color by code resource\u00a0 for the 100th day!</a>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2613\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nPresidents Day falls in February. We love the days off at the beginning of the week, but we also revisit any discussion we may have had in November surrounding Presidents.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Presidents-Day-1675804\"> I've also created this President's Day resource designed for my first graders.</a>\n<h4><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/8b89e616-6978-11ec-934a-257a83652528/presidents-day-color-by-code-election-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> I also have this free color by code resource perfect for around this time.\u00a0</a></h4>\nIt's a great way to check out the type of color by code resources I have to offer to see if you like them!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2615\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nEven if your students aren't big on love (eww cooties), it's a great time to discuss friendship and communities. Students often can think about doing nice things for friends. I like to offer during free choice time opportunities to write letters, make cards or pictures, and even teach them about friendship bracelets.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2629\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/February-Themes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nFebruary is Dental Health Month! It's a great time to teach young learners about how to take care of their teeth and all the other fun stuff that comes along with it. Dental health is also a great informational topic that also has many narrative stories that go along with it (We LOVE Dr. DeSoto). I also love having the students write tips they think the tooth fairy would give them about taking care of teeth, and even painting with toothbrushes! Check out my recent post about dental health activities here!\n\nGet my dental health activities resource <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6c615486-3f90-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/dental-health-activities\">here</a>!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBonus: Sometimes Chinese New Year falls in February and sometimes in January, so this one can be applied wherever appropriate for the year you are in!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2611\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/8-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nCheck your calendar, because Chinese New Year is sometimes in January and sometimes in February. In 2022 it's going to be on February 1, but in 2023 it's back in January on the 22nd.\n\n&nbsp;",

It's the 100th day of school!\n\nIt's a great day to celebrate all about math and to plan some fun activities for the 100th day, all focused around the number one hundred!\u00a0 100 feels like a big number when you figure that you've been in school that many days, but it's not quite as big of a number when you only have 100 seconds to complete tasks!\n\nI have used these activities with students from first grade to 5th and I have the activity booklet to offer you for free!\n\nThere are a bunch of ideas and response pages for students in the 100 Second Challenge freebie <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/3a4eab5f0653/100th-day-booklet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">linked here,</a> but I'll list a few for you here!\n<h2>100 Board Match-</h2>\nPull as many numbered tiles as you can out of a bag and match them to the hundreds chart! This is great for helping students to read numbers, navigate the 100s board, and also determine how well they understand how the board works.\n<h2>Penny Stacking</h2>\nHow many pennies can you stack in 100 seconds. For older students you could just do a coin challenge and have them calculate the value of all the coins they stacked within 100 seconds!\n<h2>Marshmallow toss</h2>\nToss as many marshmallows as you can across the table in 100 seconds. This one is just fun and gets lots of laughs!\n<h2>Beading Challenge</h2>\nHow many beads can you put on a pipe cleaner in just 100 seconds?\n<h1><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/3a4eab5f0653/100th-day-booklet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">There are 10 challenges in all included in the booklet along with direction cards for each of the activities, so be sure to grab that freebie here!</a></h1>\n<a href=\" https://mailchi.mp/3a4eab5f0653/100th-day-booklet\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2620\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Activities-for-the1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nI also want to share a couple of other fun ideas that I've done for the 100th day before that your students might love!\n<h3>100th Day Snack</h3>\nThis snack includes 100 pieces of snack! I always like to have 10 choices for snacks and students take 10 of each (to work on that place value skill as well). Some ideas for choices are different kinds of cereal, Goldfish Crackers, Cheezits, pretzels, m&amp;ms, oyster crackers, and fruit snacks.\n<h3>100th Day Crown</h3>\nI've just used basic sentence strips. Students put 10 groups of 10 different stickers, shapes, squiggles, and they make 10 of each (another plug at that place value concept)\n<h3>100th Day Cereal Necklace</h3>\nThis is always a fun one. You can use any cereal that's in the shape of a circle, but I like using Cheerios honestly. I have students bead 10 cheerios, then a plastic bead to break up the groups of 10. Of course they do this 10 times! It's also been best in my experience to splurge and get the string that has the ends like a shoelace so they are easier for students to bead.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

It's a great time to focus on learning about teeth, dental hygiene, and how to use a toothbrush and floss. Most importantly, why we do all of these things.\n\nI can't be the only mom who deals with kids who feel like \"ehh my teeth look\u00a0 ok. WHY do I need to brush them?\"\u00a0 Sometimes coming from the teacher in a school environment just reiterates what\u00a0 families and dentists have been telling students for a long time.\n\nDental health is one of the themes I covered in my classroom in February. I also covered many other themes depending on the year. I have a whole list of my favorite February themes <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/7-themes-for-elementary-classroom-in-february/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!\n\n<a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/7-themes-for-elementary-classroom-in-february/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2608\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"380\" height=\"214\" /></a>\n\nIf you want to teach your students in a fun way about dental health, you can also incorporate many different early learning skills along the way such as :\n\n*Reading Comprehension\n\n*Procedural Writing\n\n*Determining the meaning of content specific vocabulary\n\n*Fine motor skills\n\n*Reading Informational Text\n\n*Informational Writing\n\n*Science and Observations\n\n*Labeling\n\n*Narrative Writing\n\nHere are some of my favorite dental health themed printables and activities for February:\n<h1><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6c615486-3f90-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/dental-health-activities\">All About Dentist Research and Writing</a></h1>\nThis is a great topic for dental health week as well as community helper units. I have ordered a few sets of books in the past about community helpers and health through scholastic that had some great resources for learning about dentists.\nYou could also have a dentist or hygienist come to visit your class and students could use that information as a resource for writing.\n\nTo grab the printable graphic organizers and writing pages you can find them <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6c615486-3f90-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/dental-health-activities\">here</a>! (and on tpt <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Dental-Health-Activities-2371670\">here</a>)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Content Specific Vocabulary Exploration:</h1>\nUsing vocabulary word cards with dental health pictures on them can help you to illustrate and introduce vocabulary. Cards like these can also help students to identify the meaning of words in the text that they hear read to them or read themselves. With access to content vocabulary students can also be empowered to use these words in their own writing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne other thing you can do with the vocabulary cards is to either create your own words/ definitions for books that you're reading, or even using the cards that I have created, you can cut the picture away from the word and have students think about what they think the words mean prior to writing. This would sort of be like a sort. Then as they read or listen , they can adjust to correct the words and the pictures that go along with them. This is a great way to have students actively make meaning during vocabulary activities.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-779\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1753.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" />\n\nThe vocabulary cards are also very useful as visual supports for labeling activities like this one!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6c615486-3f90-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/dental-health-activities\">Tooth Fairy Tips:</a></h1>\nThis is a fun way for students to write to tell the dental health tips they have learned in somewhat of a craftivity format.Doing the cutting and folding and coloring are all great fine motor tie ins for this sort of literacy activity. It's definitely a student favor!\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6c615486-3f90-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/dental-health-activities\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2636\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dental-Health-Blog-Posts1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nWhile you're at it, you could also include a narrative prompt like this one! Kids love to use their imaginations and there are a number of stories that can help get their brains thinking!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Science and Observations:</h1>\nThis is one of my favorite activities! It's the good old hard boiled egg in cola experiment where students can see what the cola does to the shell of the egg.\u00a0 You can also demonstrate brushing the egg and using different liquids for different eggs.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6c615486-3f90-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/dental-health-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I have included all of the science journal pages in this printable.</a>\n\nIf you don't want to actually get the egg out, you could do the next activity instead (or in addition to!)\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Toothbrush painting:</h1>\nFirstly let me say... I know painting can be messy. But I really think it's so good for kids! I like to print a tooth template (included here) on brown paper and then have students use white paint to paint the tooth with paintbrushes. Even if you just have an art station they could even just create whatever painting they'd like exploring the sensory and motor involvement of painting with toothbrushes. How is it the same and different from using typical toothbrushes.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6c615486-3f90-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/dental-health-activities\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2635\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dental-Health-Blog-Posts2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n<h1><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/48465b20-6e4e-11ec-934a-257a83652528/taking-care-of-teeth-emergent-reader\">Early Reading- Printable Emergent Reader</a></h1>\nThis taking care of teeth reader is great because it is accessible to young readers and includes resources for vocabulary as well as follow up comprehension.

After we get that first snow, it's always like little bits of it seem to linger until the first signs of spring. Aside from the skinned knees and pulled muscles from slipping on ice... I don't mind the winter weather. What I do know is that the snow can get our elementary students so excited. Cue the first snowflake of a snowfall and you've got finger and noseprints all over your classroom window. Sound familiar?\n\nOne of the reasons I love thematic units in <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/10-topics-for-january-thematic-units/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">January</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/7-themes-for-elementary-classroom-in-february/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">February</a> is that they are a great chance to harness the excitements and curiosities that students already bring with them to school in order to engage them in meaningful learning tasks whether it's winter literacy centers or math stations. Throw in a fun science lesson and you've sealed the deal!\n\nSnow and snowman activities are no exception. There are SO many snowman book titles <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/favorite-snowman-stories-for-preschool-and-early-elementary/\">(click here for some of my favorites)</a> for snowy day themed literacy lessons that I never passed them by in my first grade classroom.\n\nThe great thing about this theme is also that you don't need to block a week off in the plan book. You can either gently use snowman themed read alouds all winter long, throw in a few here or there, or even have them handy in case there is a chance of snow in that forecast.\n\nI want to share with you some of my favorite snowman themed resources that I've used over the years and my students have given great reviews for!\n<h1><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/bbe68a3a-5c2d-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/how-to-build-a-snowman-writing-winter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Build a Snowman</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/bbe68a3a-5c2d-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/how-to-build-a-snowman-writing-winter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2642\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nThis procedural writing resource can also double as a sequencing activity .... or both! When you're working with procedural writing using processes that are known to students and that they can even do (even if you just use playdough!) helps students to use their brain power on the writing skill rather than trying to figure out a process that is unknown to them.\n\nWe also know that young writers also often need supports when writing. Using vocabulary cards can help students to understand vocabulary, can help you to map the words ahead of time (take a look at some of those compound words and syllable types!). Then students will be familiar with the terms, reading them, and even including them in their writing!\n\nThis particular<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/bbe68a3a-5c2d-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/how-to-build-a-snowman-writing-winter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> ready to go resource</a> includes both 4 and 8 step sequencing so whether your students are preschoolers, first graders, or second graders, you can find a way to make this resource just right for them!\n\nYou can get this resource <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/bbe68a3a-5c2d-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/how-to-build-a-snowman-writing-winter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> (<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/How-to-Build-a-Snowman-Writing-Kindergarten-and-1st-Grade-1616947\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">or here on tpt</a>).\n<h1><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f44e49b0-5cb1-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/snowman-vowel-word-work-game-winter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snowman Bump Phonics Game</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f44e49b0-5cb1-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/snowman-vowel-word-work-game-winter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2644\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nI am always looking for differentiation and independent as two characteristics for stations. This print and go spinner center is a great way to practice reading words with short vowels, digraphs, or even diphthongs. This makes for a wonderful word work or word building center. It is also fun and a little competitive with the bump nature of the game (don't worry, directions are included).\n\nI love that students can practice reading words over and over again and when they are working with a partner they are also checking each others reading which means... double decoding!\n\nI love that you can have different students working on the same station but the skill that is just right for them. Maybe you have students working on basic short vowel word families with one student. Give that group or pair the directions to use one of the short vowel spinners and game mats.Whereas if you have a pair ready for digraphs or diphthongs for example, you can choose that spinner!\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/f44e49b0-5cb1-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/snowman-vowel-word-work-game-winter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can get this spinner game here</a> (or <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/10-topics-for-january-thematic-units/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> on tpt).\n<h1><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/0d0d1a48-714c-11ec-934a-257a83652528/winter-color-by-number-bundle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Winter Color By Code</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/0d0d1a48-714c-11ec-934a-257a83652528/winter-color-by-number-bundle\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2645\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nWhile this resource includes more than just snowman pictures, each of my winter color by number resource includes a few snowman pictures.\n\nWhether you're working on <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/5d7c6a18-506c-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/winter-color-by-number\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">number identification and subitizing</a>, <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/20a11410-3bca-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/winter-color-by-number-addition-to-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">addition to 10</a>, or <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/efd81084-fa80-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5/winter-color-by-number-addition-to-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">addition to 20</a>, you can choose the set that works best for your students.\n\nIf you have diverse learners in your class, you can use the bundle to have all three versions so students can be working on the same picture but with an entirely different skill that is just right for them!\n\nI've written a bunch about why I love color by code resources (<a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/5-reasons-i-love-color-by-code-activities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">read more here</a>) as well as <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/5-ways-to-use-color-by-code-in-the-elementary-classroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to use them in the classroom\u00a0</a> but in short, I love that they are print and go, great for subs, and help with fluency practice in a fun way!\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/0d0d1a48-714c-11ec-934a-257a83652528/winter-color-by-number-bundle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can get this bundle here </a>(or on tpt <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Winter-Color-By-Number-Math-Bundle-4130462\">here</a>)\n<h1><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cfd2e338-6a57-11ec-934a-257a83652528/snowman-snowball-winter-writing-station\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Silly snowball sentence building</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cfd2e338-6a57-11ec-934a-257a83652528/snowman-snowball-winter-writing-station\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2643\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nWhen your students are ready for fluency and identifying complete sentences, this center is perfect for winter. My first graders always loved this writing center in January. I love that there are so many options so I can leave it our for quite a while before students get bored of it.\n\nIn this center, students flip over two snowballs to create a sentence.\u00a0 First students will turn over the snowballs, then flip two and decide if it makes a sentence. If so, they can use the recording sheet to write and draw the sentence. Some of them are basic and typical things, but some sentences can get silly and we all know little learners LOVE silly!\n\n<strong>If you're working on a certain skill, you can also give students additional directions and goals such as:</strong>\n\n*Highlight or underline the nouns/verbs/subject/predicate\n\n*Circle every letter ____\n\n*Find any letters that make the ___ sound\n\n*Use a capital letter at the beginning of the sentence.\n\n*Use finger spaces between words\n\n*Use end punctuation\n\nI love how you can take a ready made station that is print and go and with a simple addition of a direction really cater the activity to the needs of your students!\n\nGet this resource <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cfd2e338-6a57-11ec-934a-257a83652528/snowman-snowball-winter-writing-station\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!

They are all pretty much print and go which is always a plus!\n\nThe first type of activity included in this resource is a write the room activity ( more about why I love these here). There is a version to practice fluency with addition to 10, and a version to practice addition to 20. You can hand up whichever version is just right for your students, or hang up both and give groups of students directions to do the version that is just right for them (by paying attention to the border). This is a great way to get students up and moving, and if you're social distancing to any degree, you can really space these out around the room and give directions about the number of students who should be at any one card.\n\nThe second activity included are three differentiated bundle up worksheets. These are great for independent practice in identifying groups of 10 as a counting strategy. It also touches on beginning place value concepts. You can also reuse this activity once students have completed it by having them roll dice to color some in and still notice when they have made a 10.\n\nRoll and Color games - There are a few different versions for both numbers and addition included. Roll and color activities are great because they can be done independently or with a partner (I always use these foam dice to keep the nosie level down).\n\nSnowball Three in a Row- This game is like tic tac toe meets connect four. Students take turns solving equations and trying to get three in a row. They can, of course, try to block one another, but you have to correctly solve the equation in order to take the space.\u00a0 The directions have students using two colors to color in the circles. but if you want to get more use, you can just have them use counters to cover up the spaces and play again and again!\n\nYou can get this math resource <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/7ee95e08-713b-11ec-934a-257a83652528/snowman-math-addition-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!

Although some\u00a0 of the pages reference the book, there are also pages that ask students to write a narrative story, retell any snowman story, and more.\n\nLong story short, if you're reading snowman stories at all, you can get some use out of this.\n\nI've also included two cut and paste sentence activities in this resource. It's a great early finisher task, writing center, or even a quick and easy activity to leave for a substitute or to leave in substitute emergency plans!\n\nSpeaking of snowman stories, if you want to see some of my favorites, I've listed them on <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/favorite-snowman-stories-for-preschool-and-early-elementary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this post!</a>\n\nYou can get this set of story activities <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/274a0d3c-713b-11ec-934a-257a83652528/snowman-story-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!

Through read aloud they can also be used with students who aren't yet ready to read.\n\nThe included vocabulary cards can be introduced to support before, during and after reading activities.\n\nMost importantly the sequencing comprehension activities that follow bring value both to your readers and listeners as they build reading comprehension skills.\n\nThis is another great one to use with reading groups, as a whole group read aloud, or even to send home after a snowy day. I also like to leave these sorts of printable booklets that have the follow up activities as substitute plans since they can be done as a whole group or in small groups as well!\n\nYou can get his resource <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/0448630c-713a-11ec-934a-257a83652528/the-snow-day-emergent-reader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> (or here on <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Snow-Day-Emergent-Reader-3061600\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tpt</a>).\n<h1><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/4a71a9ce-713a-11ec-934a-257a83652528/snowman-color-word-emergent-reader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snowman Colors- Emergent Reader Freebie</a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/4a71a9ce-713a-11ec-934a-257a83652528/snowman-color-word-emergent-reader\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2646\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\nTake all the reasons I love printable emergent readers (like the ones I've listed above) and make them free... even better!

She would show us how to brush and floss. I have to confess, it was sort of frightening (the bear with people teeth part), but we got the idea. I still remember it to this day, so it definitely had an impact.\n\nNow that I think of it... I am really wondering if this is a widespread sort of practice or something that just happens local to me... let me know. Seriously... I'm dying to know if this type of bear made an appearance when you were in school!\n\nYou might have a visit from a hygienist or dentist. You might watch videos or read books about taking care of teeth (Don't miss Dr. Desoto! That's a favorite!). You might research all about dentists, or even paint with toothbrushes!\n\nI've put together a list of fun activities you can do with your students during Dental Health Month on this blog post.

A month full of love and freebies!\n\nTeaching is never easy and sometimes you might find yourself with an empty spot in your February plan book you're looking to fill. Or... maybe you want to have some fun thematic substitute activities ready to go, but you're not sure if you'll use them so you don't want to invest a lot of time and effort in finding the resources or paying for them.\n\nI also like to keep some printable activities in a file for those moments when students finish an activity earlier than expected, or we've got that awkward 10 minutes before they go to Art or PE.\n\nWhen you have a thematic activity ready it can make this \"extra\" feel fun and relevant rather than just like an extra piece of busy work. Whether it's printables for February, Valentine's Day, or Presidents' Day... I have freebies you might love for your class!\n\nI think you'll find that these February freebies might be just what you need!\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/7858d73e-793e-11ec-934a-257a83652528/february-celebrations-free-emergent-reader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>February Celebrations Printable Emergent Reader</strong></a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/7858d73e-793e-11ec-934a-257a83652528/february-celebrations-free-emergent-reader\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2678\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nThis is a great quick and easy emergent reader.

Just when the short days (that seem so long) of January are dragging on, Valentine's day can swoop in and jazz things up a little. One really quick and easy way to add a little fun to February in your elementary classroom is to have some no prep (or low prep) printables, centers, and activities right at your fingertips.\n\nYou can either plug these activities into your planbook to support Valentine's Day math, phonics, or writing lessons...or you can keep them on hand for those days when your students need something extra to fill in the time.\n\nWhen I created all of these resources (primarily for students K-2) I used them mostly in stations or for independent work time.\u00a0 I tried to make them as easy as possible to use so that you're not spending hours and hours prepping for these activities (I mean, Valentine's Day is fun, but you've got enough on your hands right?\n\nTo save you some browsing time, I want to share with you 8 of my favorite printable Valentine's Day classroom printables so you can save yourself some browsing time!\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/97e725e6-7ad9-11ec-934a-257a83652528/valentine-s-day-color-by-number-math-bundle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Valentine's Day Color By Number</strong></a></h1>\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/97e725e6-7ad9-11ec-934a-257a83652528/valentine-s-day-color-by-number-math-bundle\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2687\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Valentines-Day-Resources.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nColor by code activities are some of my favorites. I've written before about all the reasons <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/5-reasons-i-love-color-by-code-activities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I love color by number printables</a> and also<a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/5-ways-to-use-color-by-code-in-the-elementary-classroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> how I use them in the elementary school classroom.</a>\n\nOne of the things that I aimed to do when creating these color by number resources was to create differentiated versions using the same exact pictures. One of the main reasons for this was that my students really needed leveled practice. It was difficult to see some students noticing that they had different work than their peers, so I made a commitment to try to align things as much as possible.\nFor this reason, I have created three versions of this resource using the same pictures, so if you scoop up the bundle you will have all three versions and could have each student working on the same Valentine's Day coloring page, but practicing the math skill that's best for them!\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/b1ffae2e-5134-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/valentine-s-day-color-by-number\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">*Valentine's Day Color By Number</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cbbe77da-370f-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/valentine-s-day-color-by-number-addition-to-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">*Valentine's Day Addition to 10 (Doubles to 12) Color by Code</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/3bcfbe80-7ad9-11ec-934a-257a83652528/valentine-s-day-color-by-number-addition-to-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">*Valentine's Day Addition to 20 Color By code.</a>\n<h3><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/97e725e6-7ad9-11ec-934a-257a83652528/valentine-s-day-color-by-number-math-bundle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>The bundle is offered at 33% off, so you basically get one of the resources free.

This resource includes differerentiated emergent readers in the form of two printable mini books with differently leveled text. You can decide based on your readers whether you read it together, have students read it in pair or with groups, or have it be an independent literacy center.\n\nIt comes complete with appropriate vocabulary, and response activities.\n\nIt's sometimes hard to find informational texts for beginning readers that are printable and can be colored and sent home so this is a great one to use this time of year, or even tuck it away for spring.\n<h3>You can get this activity <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/9c0a89c8-7ada-11ec-934a-257a83652528/how-a-rose-grows-spring-or-valentine-s-day-procedural-writing-and-sequencing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!

It's not always easy to differentiate for students who are able to go to the next level. That's exactly why I created this spin and solve activity. It's one of the many activity types that can be used to practice almost any skill.\n\nThis particular Valentine's Day Math Station is great for practicing basic addition, adding three numbers, adding multiples of 10, multiplication, and fact families.\n\nThe great thing is that since there are four spinners you can choose the numbers and skills that are most appropriate for each student/ group of students (if you're using more of a guided math approach). Then you can choose the recording sheet that directs students to practice math at the level they are ready to practice facts.\n\nThis is another one of those resources that all the students can do, but some will be working on fact families, and other just on adding two numbers. Again, this really helps to include all students, and doesn't demand that you prepare entirely different stations for students who are working on different skills.\n<h3>You can get his resource <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/c6b0ff60-793e-11ec-934a-257a83652528/valentine-s-day-math-fact-spinner-printable-february-math-center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!

The Write the room activity is such a fun way to get students up and moving around the classroom <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/reasons-to-love-write-the-room-practice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(I've written more about this here)</a>.\n\nI\u00a0 just printed my game play cards on cardstock (so you can't see through them) and then my struggling students would practice matching (or playing go fish for the same number card) and my students who were ready for a challenge would have to make matches to make a 10. They also loved playing go-fish to make a 10. I'd just print several copies of the cards, they'd take a few in their hand and ask the others if they have the card with the value they need to make a 10 (for example someone who had a 7 would ask a friend if they have a 3).\n\nOverall I love that this resource includes a warm up (write the room), some practice pages and a follow up game all to reinforce skills just right for your students.\n<h3>You can get this resource <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/07cbd9ac-7ade-11ec-934a-257a83652528/valentine-s-day-10-frame-math-practice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!

It's important to find ways to really\u00a0 reinforce these skills without them getting too bored. Practice number 1-5 with your preschoolers using these types of activities:\n\n1- Posters- These are great to use for morning meeting or to hang around the classroom. They serve as number posters and classroom decor in February and I always like when I get check two things off my list at once!\n\n2.Clip Cards- These heart counting clip cards are great for stations or tubs. They reinforce counting and number recognition and incorporate those fine motor skills as well as children clip the clothes pins to the correct cards.\n\n3. Spin and Cover Game- This game is a lot of fun for children to play. I like to play this alongside young children to help guide them. It can be played as a pair or independently. It's also a great idea to teach them about spinner games, because once they know how it works, these types of activities can be created to <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/classroom-games-to-practice-any-skill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">practice almost any skill!</a>\n\n4.\u00a0 Number Practice Interactive Packet- This is one of those quick and easy printable booklet where students color, represent, and then find each number.

After teaching for years it became apparent to me that the isolated skill practice wasn't cutting it. Additionally students ALWAYS struggled with those word problems.

While they grow and the skills become more complicated as the year goes on, you can start using them anytime.\n\nThis journal has 15 word problems that provide relevant and relatable word problems for students to practice:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Number line to add and subtract within 20.</li>\n \t<li>Interpreting data (bar graph)</li>\n \t<li>Using a table to solve</li>\n \t<li>Place value to 50</li>\n \t<li>Adding and subtracting 10s</li>\n \t<li>Comparing quantities</li>\n \t<li>Add and subtract within 10 and 20.</li>\n</ul>\nAll of these skills are closely aligned with first grade Common Core Math Standards, but they are useful for some kindergartners and great for review or independent practice for second graders as well!\n\nDuring times of virtual learning, I also added a digital version to the resource using Google Slides. While I think the printable journal is the ideal format for young learners, the Google slides version would be great for demonstrating to the class or having students show their work!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/4b746f50-7c7f-11ec-934a-257a83652528/february-math-journal-spiraled-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can get this February Math Journal Here</a></h3>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Monthly-Word-Problems-First-Grade-Math-Journal-Bundle-3825568\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Or grab the whole bundle here!</a></h3>\n\n<hr />\n\nIf you're looking for more ideas to fill in your planbook, check out this post about <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/everything-february-printables-and-classroom-activities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Everything February!</a>\n\nIt includes a list of <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/7-themes-for-elementary-classroom-in-february/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Favorite February Themes</a> and a link to some <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/free-february-printables-for-your-classroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">February Freebies</a> I think you'd like!",

    "content": "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2703\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mid-year-reflection-blog-post.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nSo you've made it to the mid year point! Woot woot!\n\nI feel like this time of the year we finally catch our breath from all the holiday hustle and bustle, which heads right into mid year assessments. It\u2019s a great time to reflect on instruction and our routines.\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\"><strong>\u00a05 reflection questions I ask myself mid year</strong></span></h1>\n<strong>1. What is working well?</strong>\n\n<strong>2. What is the most challenging thing?</strong>\n\n<strong>3. How can I encourage independence?</strong>\n\n<strong>4.How can I keep it interesting?</strong>\n\n<strong>5. How can I support them as they \"level up\" their skills?</strong>\n\n<em>You can read more below (and get the free reflection sheets at the bottom of this post)</em>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Reflecting on what is working well:</strong></h2>\nLooking at the things that are working well in\u00a0 your classroom will help you to first, reaffirm that you are an amazing teacher (even if you're tired... even if you're stressed... even if you just \"know\" you could be doing more.). This is also a great time to look at what's working and do more of it.... or look for ways to pivot what you've been doing so it can apply to other areas during the day.\n\n<em>As an example</em>: My first year teaching I noticed that my students loved having small group work. With a class full of diverse learners receiving lots of supports within and outside of the classroom, the best parts of the day were the times that we were all working in small groups. Originally I had been having students work independently on tasks as I called groups over for reading.\n\nDuring math time, however, we rotated through with a group approach... and they LOVED it! Students were engaged and they were making tons of progress. Switching my literacy block to the same format made a world of difference. Students were more engaged in discussions, skill practice, and READING, which was the whole goal to begin with.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Reflecting on what is challenging:</strong></h2>\nThis is the hardest thing for me to do because challenges are... well.. challenging! It is sometimes defeating to feel like you're doing all you can and there are still some major challenges. Some years the challenges I've faced have been academic. Some years (most years) they have been <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/3-step-approach-to-behavior-management-plans-in-early-elementary-classrooms/\">behavioral.</a>\u00a0 Other years they have even been personal (like the year I had to be out with surgery for thyroid cancer) and I have needed to plan for a <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/10-lists-to-leave-for-your-long-term-substitute/\">long term substitute</a>.\u00a0 When you sit down and reflect at a scheduled time, rather when you're melting into your chair after a long and exhausting day, you can start to really pinpoint what the challenges are. You can put them into perspective and decide if it's<a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/establishing-quiet-classroom-routines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> routines</a> that you could focus on. Maybe it's a good time to revisit routines and <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/teaching-classroom-expectations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expectations</a>. Maybe you need to look at your schedule to try to leave on time a few days a week so you can take care of yourself!\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Encouraging Independence:</strong></h2>\nThis part of the reflection has always opened doors for my students and I. It turns out that I can often use what is working to build independence in those areas. It often opens up time and space to address the challenges. Most importantly, it empowers my students to really make progress and take ownership of their learning.\n\nOne of the things I really try to build independence with is classroom routines. Yes it's painful to teach them to hang their stuff up in cubbies at the beginning of the year. Yes it's easier to just do it for them... BUT it's so much easier in the long run if you take the time to teach them and then you can cross that task off your list.\n\nThe same goes with academic routines. For example, During my reading groups, I choose some <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/reading-comprehension-building-independence-in-beginning-readers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">basic discussion prompts</a> with picture cues that I taught the children how to respond to.\u00a0 I would have students take turns picking the prompt for the book or story they were reading. By the springtime, students ( even first graders) were able to use this routing to independently engage in reading discussion groups.\n\nWhatever your routine is, take some time to analyze if there is a way to encourage independence.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Keeping It Interesting:</b></h2>\nBy this time of year, students should be pretty used to routines. In fact, this is how we encourage independence to begin with. However, you can definitely jazz things up to reengage students with some fun little twists in your lessons. One of my favorite ways to get students excited is using <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/reading-comprehension-with-sticky-notes-story-parts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sticky notes.</a> I like to print their focus or discussion prompt on sticky notes in order to remind them of their task. If I am being honest though, it\u2019s partially also because they just love sticky notes so much that they just seem to be instantly engaged.\n\nAnother thing I will sometimes introduce this time of year is gallery walks. Since they are typically writers now and have had some time sharing ideas and responding to others, just hanging those literacy or math prompts around the room and having them respond is another great way to get them moving while keeping the tasks fresh.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Helping students level up!</b></h2>\nAs you move towards spring it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re also moving into some more independent and complex academic demands. Maybe you\u2019re working on making inferences now. Maybe the focus is on connecting two texts.\u00a0 Perhaps you\u2019re really delving into characters.\u00a0 Whatever the skill might be, don\u2019t forget about old favorite strategies, techniques, and even favorite books.\n\nBy this time in the year, my students have a pile of mentor texts that they practically know by heart. For example, I like to use fairy tales to teach identifying story parts and retelling. I also pull out those<a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/fairy-tales-to-teach-comprehension-lessons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> fairy tales</a> later in the year when it comes to drawing conclusions about characters and making connections. When you take an old story that they already have experience with and pull it into the mix, it lessens the demand of knowing the basic storyline and lets them really dig into the new skills and practice.\n\nThe same is true for math skills. Pull out those old skills and build on them for new learning. For example, maybe your students are transitioning from using a provided numberline from 1-20 to drawing their own open number line. Making those connections to the strategies and tools they are already comfortable with will help them to continue to grow as learners into the spring.\n\n<hr />\n\nI've created a basic mid year reflection worksheet if you'd like to grab it <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6ce3a122-7ec5-11ec-934a-257a83652528/mid-year-teacher-reflection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6ce3a122-7ec5-11ec-934a-257a83652528/mid-year-teacher-reflection\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2704\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mid-year-reflection-blog-post1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;",

It's one of my favorite times of year because we start to see the first signs of winter receding here in the northeast. Some years it's the first time we see the grass, and students LOVE being able to have more snow-free space to run around during extra recess. It's also a really fun time to get into all things St. Patrick's day and more!\n\nAs you know, I love teaching with thematic units, even if it just means finding some small ways to incorporate themes throughout the months.\u00a0 My students always got a kick out of the earrings, or sometimes even the leggings I would wear to make things a little fun and interesting as they connected to a seasonal theme.\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Here are 11 themes or topics for March that you might find helpful!</span></h1>\n<h2>St. Patrick's Day</h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2729\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nLet's start with the one that often comes to mind first. Especially in the younger grades the St. Patrick's Day holiday brings about so much excitement for students. I have fond memories of my own childhood creating fancy and extravagant leprechaun traps (ok ok.. they were usually tissue boxes with some Lucky Charms at the bottom, but they felt fancy at the time.) Don't miss this FREE set of <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/132c276e-757d-11eb-89a7-42f8f90fddc5/st-patrick-s-day-notes-from-lucky-the-leprechaun\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notes from Lucky!</a>\n\nStudents love the mystery and fun surrounding the holiday.

I differentiated it for some students as a counting and visual planning project, but it works either way. Basically students use grid paper to design a leprechaun house. It's so much fun! You can check it out here (or here on tpt).\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Math-Project-Leprechaun-House-Area-and-Perimeter-3659182\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2734\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/March-Themes-and-Topics.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" height=\"234\" /></a>\n\nI also find that students are super excited about writing when it's thematic so I have a ton of St. Patrick's Day writing activities that I use during the first part of March.\u00a0 <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/7-fun-st-patricks-day-activities-for-your-class/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can read more about some of my favorite St. Patrick's Day Resources here</a>!\n\nI also have begun adding preschool resources, and I have a super cute and useful St. Patrick's Day resource.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Preschool-St-Patricks-Day-Activities-5323699\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2739\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/March-Themes-and-Topics8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"323\" height=\"182\" /></a>\n<h2>Rainbows</h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2727\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nThe rainbow theme goes nicely with the St. Patrick's Day theme, but also blends well with units on weather, observation, and even spring\u00a0 (which also comes up this month!)

I always start with <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/a4285286-9649-11ec-9431-eb3419618d4a/goodbye-winter-hello-spring\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goodbye Winter , Hello Spring\u00a0\u00a0 </a>(here on <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Goodbye-Winter-Hello-Spring-1667881?utm_source=My%20Blog&amp;utm_campaign=March%20Themes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tpt</a>) It's also wonderful because any of the thematic spring resources you use are still relevant for many months, so they are useful for a long window of time. I find, for example, when I am leaving sub plans, I usually have a set of emergency plans that are for each season.\u00a0 This way students aren't bored with lessons that are totally disconnected from everything else that's going on in the classroom.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/First-Grade-Spring-Literacy-Centers-Bundle-1765309\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2737\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/March-Themes-and-Topics3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"414\" height=\"233\" /></a></p>\nI love incorporating spring literacy centers too! You can check out the ones I use <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cc2b51c8-5f25-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/spring-literacy-center-bundle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!\n<h2>Rabbits</h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2723\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nSpring leaps us right into noticing animals and life all around us. Especially if you talked about hibernation during the winter months. it's fun to see some animals, like rabbits appear in the spring. In our yard we tend to see baby rabbits grow almost every year.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ed5f3b50-46bd-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/life-cycle-of-a-rabbit\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2740\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/March-Themes-and-Topics11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"393\" height=\"221\" /></a></p>\nWhether you're learning about the<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ed5f3b50-46bd-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/life-cycle-of-a-rabbit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> life cycle of a rabbit</a>, or reading rabbit themed stories, students really love this topic. Tops and Bottoms - Adapted and Illustrated by Janet Stevens (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm5nAcqWmJU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here's a link to a read aloud version</a>) is one of my favorite stories to read this time of year.\n\nI also created <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Rabbit-Emergent-Readers-Bundle-3101314\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">these printable emergent readers</a>. There are four of them in all and two are informational and two are fictional. They are great for independent work, substitute plans, or to send home with students to share what they have learned with their families.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Rabbit-Emergent-Readers-Bundle-3101314\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2741\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/March-Themes-and-Topics13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" height=\"234\" /></a>\n\nThis is also a great theme to save for Easter time if that is something that you discuss in your classroom. If you don't discuss Easter, it's still a great theme to use around that time because the students who do celebrate will have an extra layer of engagement, while others will still be learning and reading about animals.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Frogs</h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2721\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nI have always loved frogs. Have I mentioned that my oldest kiddo's nursery was once frog themed? I have fond memories of catching them and setting them free as a kid in the little stream next to our town library.\n\nAnyway, this is a great theme for students this time of year because it's a wonderful time to learn about the <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/5931a104-a5f6-11eb-89a8-42f8f90fddc5/life-cycle-of-a-frog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">life cycle of a frog</a> since it can happen right before your eyes! If you're able to, you can even bring this life cycle into the classroom, which is super fun.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/5931a104-a5f6-11eb-89a8-42f8f90fddc5/life-cycle-of-a-frog\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2742\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/March-Themes-and-Topics6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"372\" height=\"209\" /></a>\n\nAnytime students are learning about something new, I find that they are super motivated to write as well! Here are some of my favorite <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cfdcd36c-a5e9-11eb-89a8-42f8f90fddc5/frog-writing-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Frog Writing Activities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </a>(<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Frog-Writing-Activities-6803868?utm_source=My%20Blog&amp;utm_campaign=March%20Themes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here on tpt</a>)\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cfdcd36c-a5e9-11eb-89a8-42f8f90fddc5/frog-writing-activities\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2743\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/March-Themes-and-Topics7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"464\" height=\"261\" /></a>\n\nIt's also the time of year that my first graders were getting super excited to read chapter books, so our good friends Frog and Toad made an appearance every year around this time (Check out the book studies here).\n<h2>Caterpillars and Butterflies</h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2725\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nAnother great way to watch and learn about <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Butterfly-Life-Cycle-Activities-and-Research-Companion-3698039\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">life cycles</a> is by having caterpillars in your classroom. We love watching the caterpillars grow and change and eventually go through metamorphosis. It's incredible to me every single time. It's also a great time for students to learn to make observations, connect the informational text that they are reading with real life changes that they can see. It definitely lends itself to an applied vocabulary since student read words and then use them as they talk about what they are seeing happen.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/9ac8588e-964a-11ec-9431-eb3419618d4a/life-cycle-of-a-butterfly\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2744\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/March-Themes-and-Topics12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"346\" height=\"195\" /></a>\n\nIt's also a great tie-in for some color by code math practice (<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/search?shop_id=172d6ede-f4f7-11e9-8477-42f8f90fddc5&amp;keywords=butterfly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find that here!</a>)\n\nYou'll see this theme discussed again because it's one of my favorites for any time in the spring. In fact, I have also used this theme in the fall time before as a fun way to start the year!\n<h1>Ducks</h1>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2724\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nThere are SO many great stories about ducks, and I feel like all the duck and pond life things are perfect for this time of year! Whether you're reading <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ac754e2c-510d-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/make-way-for-ducklings-book-activities-with-digital-distance-learning-component\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Make Way for Ducklings</a>, The Ugly Duckling (<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/3d5a87c6-5c31-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/the-ugly-duckling-story-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here are some story activities</a>), Duck at the Door ... there are just so many great ones.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/The-Ugly-Duckling-Activities-4380316\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2738\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/March-Themes-and-Topics4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"374\" height=\"211\" /></a>\n\nThis is a wonderful topic to tie that paired text connection in with. Read stories, learn about ducks, and then synthesize that information as they <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/57c334c0-7129-11ea-950b-42f8f90fddc5/duck-writing-activities-report-digital-components-for-distance-learning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">write and share</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Make-Way-For-Ducklings-and-Duck-Writing-Bundle-1803109\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2745\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/March-Themes-and-Topics9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" height=\"234\" /></a>\n\nHere are my favorite Duck themed activities!\n<h2>Women's History Month</h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2720\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nMarch is Women's History month! You can do so much, even with your youngest learners to celebrate the accomplishments of women. I have written about some of my favorite books with strong girls as main characters here. Zoey and Sassafras is one of my favorite series for first and second graders.\n\nThere are also a bunch of great picture books like The House that Cleaned Itself, The Girl With A Mind For Math and more! <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/picture-book-biographies-about-strong-women/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I have some freebies for these books linked here.</a>\n<h2>Weather</h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2722\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nAny time the season changes so does the weather. I think the transition from winter to spring is a great time to discuss and learn about weather since everything changes so quickly. We often see different types of precipitation and storms. I got a whole set of beginning readers from Scholastic one year that my students loved and they wrote all about different types of weather (of their choosing) using <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/e4b5f0be-3bc5-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/extreme-weather-research-companion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this extreme weather research companion</a>. (or <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Extreme-Weather-Research-Project-4124178?utm_source=blog.printablerprompts.com&amp;utm_campaign=March%20Themes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> on tpt) By this time of the year I feel like they are just hungry to research and learn since it's something we've been practicing all year long.\n<h2>Luck</h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2728\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nWhile this theme kind of connects to the St. Patrick's Day resources, it's another time of the year that we can use this topic to go in a couple of different directions.\n\nFirst, you can kind of use this like a refresher for the gratitude thinking and writing you have done around Thanksgiving time.\n\nThe other thing you can begin to tie in is probability. It's fun to play games where students start to explore probability and even through games \"luck\".\u00a0 My first graders loved thinking about whether an accomplishment was based on luck, skill, or both. I liked the tie in that came naturally to that meta cognitive sort of thought process as well.\n<h2>Easter</h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2719\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nI know that some schools spend time discussing Easter and others don't. I have often used Easter themed word problems and discussed the student experience with traditions and fun around Easter. I should also mention that Easter is sometimes in March and other times it's in April.\u00a0 If you want to grab those word problems, they're a great sample of my spiraled review word problem journals.<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6677d2f6-6854-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/easter-word-problem-practice-free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Grab that freebie here!</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\nHave an idea for a theme I should add to the list?

Learning about life cycles is so engaging to students because they\u00a0 are using their observational skills to notice and comment on what happens... and the changes sometimes seem magical! I usually teach about life cycles in springtime, but I've come to learn that there are animals around all year long that students are excited to learn about.\n\nThe thing I love about life cycles is that when we are talking about animals (and even plants!) students get really excited. Since these concepts are so engaging you can actually study many different life cycles , but change your objective or the task at hand to engage students while practicing a wide range of academic skills.\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Learning and writing about life cycles helps students to practice:</strong></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Making observations</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Drawing and writing to communicate observations</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Using content specific vocabulary in context</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Research and \"all about\" writing skills</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Making predictions</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Drawing conclusions</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Asking and answering questions</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Sequencing</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Sequential writing</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Informational Writing</p>\nWhen it comes to students showing what they know about life cycles, there are several different formats I have used in the past!\nCheck out these types of life cycle activities my students have enjoyed through the years!\n\nPicture Sequencing\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Life-Cycle-Activities-Bundle-3698050?utm_source=blog.printableprompts.com&amp;utm_campaign=Life%20Cycle%20Post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2757\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLife Cycle Cut and Paste (and write)\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Life-Cycle-Activities-Bundle-3698050?utm_source=blog.printableprompts.com&amp;utm_campaign=Life%20Cycle%20Post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2758\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLife Cycle Booklet\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Life-Cycle-Activities-Bundle-3698050?utm_source=blog.printableprompts.com&amp;utm_campaign=Life%20Cycle%20Post\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2759 size-full\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\nLife Cycle Wheel\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Life-Cycle-Activities-Bundle-3698050?utm_source=blog.printableprompts.com&amp;utm_campaign=Life%20Cycle%20Post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2760\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm a huge fan of having choices for students and teachers. I know that in a class with learner diversity, a teacher might even need two different methods for the same content, which is why all of these activities are included in each of my life cycle resources! For most of them I also include vocabulary cards and research companion materials so students can also organize things they have learned about each animal and then write informational pieces.\n\n<a

It's always fun compiling my favorite themes and topics for each month, but when I sat down to make a list of April topics and May themes, I realized that there was <em>so much overlap! </em> Since spring tends to be such a busy time for teachers and families, I thought I'd sum up favorite spring themes here which would be great for either March or April!\n\nI love that thematic units give us, as teachers, a way to engage our students in high interest lessons, projects, activities, and even purposeful play!\n<h1><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">Here are some of my favorite themes for spring!</span></h1>\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2781\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nWe have all heard the saying about April showers! April is a great time to pick up some of your favorite rainy day book, like The Rain Came Down and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs! My first graders always loved to pull out <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/7e0e36f2-ba21-11ea-950b-42f8f90fddc5/henry-and-mudge-in-puddle-trouble\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Henry and Mudge in Puddle Trouble</a> as well!\nI created this general set of <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/47fb524e-46b7-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/rainy-day-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rainy day activities</a>, with some pages to go with popular stories as well, so that I could have them on hand to keep kids learning on those dreary days!\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2780\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nRainbow theme is great for St. Patrick's Day and March, but any time there are rainy and sunny days, you have a chance of getting lucky and seeing a rainbow! That's one of the reasons that Rainbow Observation activities are great to include in the spring. My favorites are the color changing white flowers, and the fizzy rainbow science experiment.\u00a0 Check out the printables that I use with the two activities below <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/a327aa1e-6273-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/rainbow-science-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>! (or<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Rainbow-Science-Observation-Projects-4412391\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> here on tpt</a>)\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/a327aa1e-6273-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/rainbow-science-activities\"><img class=\"wp-image-2785 alignleft\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"274\" height=\"154\" /></a> <img class=\"wp-image-2786 alignleft\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"151\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2779\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nOk, I know that this one seems obvious, but there are so many great stories and activities just related to the changing of seasons that are great for students! At the beginning of spring I love to read one of my favorite spring season stories , or go on a nature walk, and then complete a Goodbye Winter, Hello Spring sorting and writing activity! You can get this one <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/a4285286-9649-11ec-9431-eb3419618d4a/goodbye-winter-hello-spring\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>! (or <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Goodbye-Winter-Hello-Spring-1667881\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here on tpt</a>) I also love to use basic <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cc2b51c8-5f25-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/spring-literacy-center-bundle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spring literacy centers</a> for first graders to keep them practicing literacy skills in a relevant way as the seasons change!<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/a4285286-9649-11ec-9431-eb3419618d4a/goodbye-winter-hello-spring\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2787\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Spring-themes-photos.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"364\" height=\"205\" /></a>\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2774\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nGoing along with seasonal changes is always noticing the weather. Spring is a great time to do some weather research or learn about weather. This is especially true since the temperature is usually tolerable to students, and you see such a variety of weather, especially in early spring here in New England for us!\u00a0 I have a set of early readers from Scholastic, and also showed some great videos and placed some library books about different types of weather into a research center and used it along side this <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/e4b5f0be-3bc5-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/extreme-weather-research-companion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Extreme Weather Research Companion</a>. Students loved being able to research and write about the weather type they chose with the graphic organizers and report template! (you can also get it <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Extreme-Weather-Research-Project-4124178\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here on tpt</a>)\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2777\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nDucks are one of my FAVORITE themes for springtime. I think this was definitely especially exciting for us at our school since we have a duck family who through the years always raises ducklings in our school courtyard.\nReading Make Way for Ducklings,\u00a0 researching and learning about ducks, learn about how ducks grow, or do some other duck themed writing are all ways to incorporate duck. The reason I love this theme is because there are so many fiction and informational books about ducks, so it's a great opportunity to do some paired text studies as well!\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2776\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nWe can't forget rabbits in the springtime! Rabbits are an animal that most students are familiar with, but they are also a great one to have come visit from a local farm or shelter like we do in our town, so you can really make a study about rabbits come to life! Here's the<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ed5f3b50-46bd-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/life-cycle-of-a-rabbit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> research companion and life cycle resource</a> I created to use during our thematic unit! (you can also get it <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Life-Cycle-of-A-Rabbit-and-Research-Report-Activity-3701578\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here on tpt</a>)\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ed5f3b50-46bd-11ea-87d7-42f8f90fddc5/life-cycle-of-a-rabbit\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2788\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Spring-themes-photos1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"338\" height=\"190\" /></a></p>\nI love doing this study near Easter since it's a way to learn about nature and animals, engage students who are excited about Easter, but also have equally meaningful learning for students who do not celebrate!\nI also created a set of emergent readers to use with students in the springtime. They are printable booklets with follow up comprehension activities. Two of them are narrative and two of them are informational readers for students. You can check these out <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Rabbit-Emergent-Readers-Bundle-3101314\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>!\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2775\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nFrogs are another great animal to research about in the springtime, especially if you have the ability to have tadpoles in your classroom, or have a nearby pond you can visit with students. They grow and change so quickly and the stages of the life cycle are so distinctive.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/5931a104-a5f6-11eb-89a8-42f8f90fddc5/life-cycle-of-a-frog\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2789\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Spring-themes-photos2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" /></a>\n\nWe also can't forget about how much students love to read Frog and Toad books this time of year! I find that this is the perfect time for my first graders as well. They are ready to read beginning chapter books, so these <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Frog-and-Toad-Book-Study-Bundle-2394049\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Frog and Toad comprehension resources</a> keep them engaged during reading time!\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2773\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nEarth Day is in April! It's a great time in spring to do some clean up, or even <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/c9445ea2-8fec-11eb-89a7-42f8f90fddc5/how-to-plant-a-tree-earth-day-emergent-reader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plant a tree</a> or <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/ad1dc27c-5c30-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/how-to-plant-a-flower\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plant some flowers</a>! Students love to feel empowered to know ways to take\u00a0 care of our earth!\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2771\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nOur school garden is coming to life! If you don't have one already, it would be a great time to check into picking a small patch of land that you could use to plant some flowers or vegetables!\n\nSome of my<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/cc2b51c8-5f25-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/spring-literacy-center-bundle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> spring literacy centers</a> are also flower themed and are great for this time of year!\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2772\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nYou'll start to see those creepy crawlies emerge and hatch and buzz around this time of year. Bugs and insects are another great theme for a research station. Place some books, show some videos, and then <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Bug-and-Insect-Report-Research-Companion-4405896\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">provide students with graphic organizers and report writing pages to help them to share what they have learned.</a>\n\nIt's also fun to include the theme into math with a<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Bug-Math-Center-Game-4406033\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> printable spinner station</a> that you can use with any basic math facts (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).\n\n<a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Bug-Math-Center-Game-4406033\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2790\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Spring-themes-photos5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"389\" height=\"219\" /></a>\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2778\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nIf you haven't already studied caterpillars and butterflies, spring is a great time. I've used the unit in both the fall and spring, and just made modifications with the first graders for the amount of writing I expected from them since so much changes during that first grade year. This is another great time to watch a life cycle in action! Students can see the caterpillars grow and change, notice their body parts, observe behaviors, and then watch the magic of metamorphosis.\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/9ac8588e-964a-11ec-9431-eb3419618d4a/life-cycle-of-a-butterfly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This Butterfly Life Cycle resource</a> helped to guide my students through the unit!\n\n<a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/9ac8588e-964a-11ec-9431-eb3419618d4a/life-cycle-of-a-butterfly\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2791\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Spring-themes-photos6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"378\" height=\"213\" /></a>\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2770\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nIf you have kids in your class who play baseball in the spring, you might already know that it can be pretty consuming this time of year. They are often buzzing with excitement over games, spending evenings at practice, and afternoons tossing a ball with a sibling or friend. Consider adding some fun baseball themed stations into your classroom to keep kiddos excited and engaged!\n\n<hr />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2769\" src=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" />\n\nEaster is sometimes in April (and other times in March). If it's appropriate for your students, including some <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/6677d2f6-6854-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/easter-word-problem-practice-free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Easter Word Problem practice (free)</a>, or sequencing and writing about <a href=\"https://shop.printableprompts.com/p/9d01e122-5cb5-11ea-95b3-42f8f90fddc5/how-to-dye-easter-eggs-procedural-writing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to dye Easter eggs</a>, might be fun curricular activities for this time of year!\n\n<hr />\n\nOk, so what did I miss?\n\nFeel free to comment with other favorite spring themes you use in your classroom!\n\nIf you're looking for themes for other times of year, <a href=\"https://blog.printableprompts.com/thematic-units-and-topics-for-the-year-elementary-school/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">check out this post</a>!\n\nLooking for favorite April printable activities?
