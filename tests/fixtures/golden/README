These are real blog export files. They cannot be recreated.

The original blogs are offline or the export endpoints no longer exist.
The XML files are the irreplaceable source artifacts. The JSON files are
the expected parser output frozen at the time of capture.

Do not delete these files. Do not regenerate the JSON without verifying
the diff is intentional. If you change parser behavior, run:

    make update-golden

and review the diff before committing.
